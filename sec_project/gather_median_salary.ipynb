Although permitted by the SEC, we did not use the 5% de minimis rule to exclude or eliminate any employee group. Approximately 56032employees related to acquisitions we completed during 2017 were excluded from the calculation. After identifying the median employee based on our consistently applied compensation measure of actual total cash compensation, we calculated the annual total compensation using the same methodology we use for the CEO as set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table. The median employee8217s total compensation was approximately $49,623. Based on this methodology, we estimate that the ratio of CEO pay to median employee pay is 297:1. 46Table of ContentsTHE FOLLOWING REPORTS OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE SOLICITING MATERIAL OR TO BE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ANY PREVIOUS OR FUTURE DOCUMENTS FILED BY THE COMPANY WITH THE SEC UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY INCORPORATES SAID REPORTS BY REFERENCE IN ANY SUCH DOCUMENT.COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORTThe Compensation Committee of the Board has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this Proxy Statement with management.

Each of the members is 8220independent8221 as defined by the NYSE and SEC.Management is responsible for the Company8217s internal controls, financial reporting process and compliance with the laws and regulations and ethical business standards. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company8217s consolidated financial statements and an audit of the effectiveness of the Company8217s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and to issue reports thereon. The Audit Committee8217s responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes and to report its findings to the Board. The Audit Committee members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of management and the independent registered public accounting firm, nor can the Audit Committee certify that the independent registered public accounting firm is 8220independent8221 under applicable rules.

      "PAY RATIO Under SEC regulations, we are required to calculate and disclose the total annual compensation paid to our median employee, as well as the ratio of the total compensation paid to the median employee as compared to the total compensation paid to our CEO (147CEO Pay Ratio148). Set forth below is a description of the methodology, including material assumptions, adjustments and estimates, we used to identify the median employee for purposes of calculating the CEO Pay Ratio:   149  We identified the median employee using our employee population as of December31, 2017. For this purpose, we identified all company employees on payroll and all individuals who would receive an IRS Form 1099 from the Company and who did not meet the following exclusion criteria: (i)receipt of annual payments from the Company that totaled less than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) (ii) employment by another entity, such as employment as faculty of a university (iii) 1099 recipient constituted a generally recognizable, bona fide service provider such as a law firm or accounting firm and (iv) 1099 recipient employed more than two or more employees and has other bona fide clients.   149  In determining compensation for purposes of the median calculation, we used each employee146s annual base pay, annual bonus and regular annual equity awards (at grant date fair value). For individuals receiving 1099s and not excluded based on the criteria above, the amount of compensation reflected in the individual146s Form 1099 was the annual compensation number utilized.  47 Table of Contents  149  We annualized the base salary earned in 2017 by permanent employees (full-time and part-time) hired after January1, 2017. Using this approach, we selected the median of our employee population. Once the median employee was identified, we then calculated annual total compensation for this employee in accordance with the requirements of the Summary Compensation Table. For 2017, the median of the annual total compensation of our employees (other than our CEO) was $163,432 and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $4,217,189. The ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees other than the CEO was 25.8. The pay ratio above represents the Company146s reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the rule and applicable guidance. The rule and guidance provide significant flexibility in how companies identify the median employee, and each company may use a different methodology and make different assumptions particular to that company. As a result, as the SEC explained when it adopted the rule, in considering the pay-ratio disclosure, stockholders should keep in mind that the rule was not designed to facilitate comparisons of pay ratios among different companies, even companies within the same industry, but rather to allow stockholders to better understand and assess each particular company146s compensation practices and pay-ratio disclosures. Neither the Compensation Committee nor our management used our CEO Pay Ratio measure in making compensation decisions.  48 Table of Contents POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL The following table provides information concerning the estimated payments and benefits that each named executive officer would be entitled under the Severance Plan. Payments and benefits are estimated assuming that the triggering event took place on December31, 2017. There can be no assurance that a triggering event would produce the same or similar results as those estimated below if such event occurs on any other date or at any other price, of if any other assumption used to estimate potential payments and benefits is not correct. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any potential payments or benefits, any actual payments and benefits may be different.

      "PAY RATIO Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the related SEC rule (the x201CRulex201D), we are required to provide our shareholders with specified disclosure regarding the relationship of our Chief Executive Officerx2019s total compensation to the total compensation of our median employee, referred to as x201Cpay-ratiox201D disclosure.For 2017, the annual total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, including the value of employer paid health care benefits, as discussed below, was $9,403,046 and for our median employee was $134,639 (also including the value of employer paid health care benefits), resulting in a pay ratio of approximately seventy to one.  The annual total compensation for our Chief Executive Officerin the pay ratio disclosure differs from the annual total compensation amounts reflected in the Summary Compensation Table because we included the value of employer paid health care benefits (estimated for ourChief Executive Officerand eligible dependents at $22,552), in order to produce a more representative disclosure of our employeesx2019 compensation. We also added the value of employer paid health care benefits to the median compensated employeex2019s compensation (estimated for the employee and such employeex2019s eligible dependents at $15,211) for purposes of this pay ratio disclosure. The annual total compensation for our median compensated employee does not represent an average of the compensation paid to our employees, but rather it is the compensation paid to the particular employee identified as our median employee.  We identified the median compensated employee by (i) aggregating for each applicable employee (A) base salary as of October 1, 2017 (or wages multiplied by annual work schedule, for hourly employees), (B) the target bonus for 2017 and (C) the accounting value of any equity awards granted during 2017, and (ii) ranking this annual compensation measure for our employees from lowest to highest.  This calculation was performed for 2,002 individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on October 1, 2017, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis. In order to present a more accurate representation of comparative annual compensation, we annualized compensation for any permanent employees that were only employed for part of 2017. No employees located in jurisdictions outside of the United States were excluded from the calculation under the regulationx2019s de minimis exemption.  This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the Rule.In light of the numerous different methodologies, assumptions, adjustments and estimates that companies may apply in compliance with the Rule, this information should not be used as a basis for comparison between different companies.  75  Table of Contents  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION David W.

      "Pay Ratio The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and SEC Regulation S-K require a public company to disclose the annual total compensation of its Principal Executive Officer (PEO), the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the company except the PEO, and the ratio of those two amounts. In determining the median employee of Ally, a list of all 7,912160employees, excluding the PEO, as of December 31, 2017, was prepared. Our 36 international employees, of whom 35 employees are located in Canada and one employee located in Belgium, were excluded from the list. Excluding them, the number of employees used in determining the median employee was 7,876. To identify our median employee from our adjusted employee population, we used base salary plus 2017 target incentive opportunities. Base salaries were annualized for those permanent employees who were not employed by us for all of 2017. Once we identified our median employee, we determined our median employee8217s annual total compensation for 2017 by using the same methodology we used for purposes of determining the annual total compensation of our NEOs for 2017 (as set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table on page 32). In addition, the annual total compensation of our PEO and our median employee was adjusted to include the cost of estimated employer contributions for medical and dental benefits and tuition reimbursements for 2017. As a result, the adjusted annual total compensation for 2017 of our PEO, Mr. Brown, was $8,848,062, which includes $14,711 of employer contributions for medical and dental benefits in 2017 in addition to compensation set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table. Mr. Brown8217s compensation is 84 times our median employee8217s 2017 annual total compensation of $105,515. The foregoing ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner permitted under SEC rules. Please note that SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and apply various assumptions and, as result, the pay ratio reported by us may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.    -40- 2018 Proxy Statement   OTHER PROPOSALS  PROPOSAL 3 8212 RATIFICATION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE8217S ENGAGEMENT OF DELOITTE amp TOUCHE LLP AS THE COMPANY8217S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2018 The AC is solely and directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the Company8217s independent registered public accounting firm.

The Board asks our stockholders to ratify the AC8217s engagement of Deloitte amp Touche as the Company8217s independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2018. The AC, however, will retain its sole authority over the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the Company8217s independent auditor. As a result, in the event that the engagement of Deloitte amp Touche is not ratified by stockholders, the AC will consider that action in the ongoing exercise of its authority over the independent auditor but will be under no obligation to engage a new independent auditor. In addition, even if the engagement is ratified, the AC will retain its discretion to terminate the appointment at any time during the year, to engage a new independent auditor, and to take any other related action if judged by the AC to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Representatives of Deloitte amp Touche are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. We also expect that these representatives will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders. The Board recommends that stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the Audit Committee8217s engagement of Deloit\n"

      "Pay RatioThe below table shows the ratio of the median annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (excluding the Chief Executive Officer) to the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer. In determining the median employee, a listing was prepared of all current employees as of December 31, 2017. To determine the median employee, we included the annual base salary as of December 31, 201732and incentive compensation related to the 201732fiscal year.

Because the Consultants did not and do not provide any non-compensation related services to our Company, we believe that each of the Consultants is and was independent of management and provides and provided the Compensation Committee with objective advice. As part of their engagements, the Consultants participated in meetings with both the Compensation Committee and senior management to learn more about our business strategy and executive compensation objectives. The Compensation Committee retained each of the Consultants directly, although in carrying out assignments, the Consultants also interacted in certain capacities with our management-level employees. All such assignments are approved by the Chairman of the Compensation Committee, Nathaniel M. Zilkha. For additional information, please refer to the discussion on page 22 under the heading 147Compensation Consultant Independence and Conflicts of Interest Assessment.148 Role of the President and Chief Executive Officer. In the course of deliberating certain 2017 compensation decisions for our Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee took into account the recommendations of Mr.Kusserow regarding the compensation of our other executive officers, including the compensation packages of the executive officers who joined the Company in 2017. Mr.Kusserow146s recommendations were based upon his assessment of each executive officer146s individual role, retention considerations and market factors. The Compensation Committee reviewed these recommendations before making its decision. While the Compensation Committee requested Mr.Kusserow to be present at certain Committee meetings when executive compensation was discussed, Mr.Kusserow did not play any role in the Compensation Committee146s deliberation of matters impacting his own compensation, and only Compensation Committee members are permitted to vote on matters related to executive officer compensation. Review of Peer Group, Industry and Survey Data In 2017, Pay Governance reviewed and recommended changes to the Company146s peer group for purposes of evaluating our compensation decisions for our executive officers and non-employee directors. Pay Governance recommended a change in the peer group from the peer group used in 2016 as a result of a high level of mergers and acquisitions activity among healthcare companies in late 2016 and 2017. Pay Governance used the following guidelines in recommending a peer group to the Compensation Committee: (a)primarily included healthcare services and healthcare facilities, (b)similarly-sized based on revenue, (c)comparable business operations, primarily focusing on home health, hospice and personal care, but also other healthcare services and facilities sub-industries, and (d)a  52 Table of Contents preference for companies with medical staff employment. The peer group used for benchmarking executive officer compensation and non-employee director compensation in 2017 consisted of the following companies:  149 Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.  149 Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. 149 Almost Family, Inc.  149 HealthSouth Corporation 149 AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.  149 LHC Group, Inc. 149 BioScrip, Inc.  149 MEDNAX, Inc. 149 Brookdale Senior Living Inc.  149 National HealthCare Corporation 149 Chemed Corporation  149 The Ensign Group, Inc. 149 Civitas Solutions, Inc.  149 The Providence Service Corporation Changes made to the peer group for 2017 include: exclusion of Air Methods Corporation, AmSurg Corp., Five Star Senior Living Inc. and Team Health Holdings, Inc. and the inclusion of Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc., Almost Family, Inc., AMN Healthcare Services, Inc., Civitas Solutions, Inc., Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. and LHC Group, Inc. Evaluating the Overall Competitiveness and Reasonableness of our 2017 Incentive Compensation Program. Based on its review of the information described above, the Compensation Committee determined that the components of our 2017 Named Executive Officer compensation program were reasonable. While the Compensation Committee generally considers available peer group, industry and survey data to be helpful in understanding how our compensation levels compare to other companies, peer group, industry and survey data are only one factor that the Compensation Committee may consider in making its decisions regarding executive compensation. For example, the Compensation Committee also considers the alignment of our then-current compensation practices with our compensation philosophy, program structure, retention goals and other factors (such as the integration of large acquisitions) before making comp\n"

      "PAY RATIO As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Aptar is providing the following disclosure about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees to the annual total compensation of Stephan Tanda, our President and CEO. To better understand this disclosure, we think it is important to give context to our operations. As a global organization, approximately 82% of our employees are located outside of the United States, with approximately 7,000 employees located in Europe and 2,600 employees located in Asia and South America. We strive to create a competitive global compensation program in terms of both the position and the geographic location in which the employee is located. As a result, our compensation program varies amongst each local market in order to allow us to provide a competitive compensation package. Pay Ratio For 2017: middot The median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, other than Mr.Tanda, was $39,366. middot Mr.Tanda's annual total compensation was $6,376,678. This amount is greater than the amount reported in the Total column of the 2017 Summary Compensation Table due to the annualization of Mr.Tanda's compensation to reflect his appointment to the position of President and CEO of Aptar on February1, 2017, as discussed further below. middot Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr.Tanda to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 162 to1. Supplemental Ratio middot Several items included in Mr.Tanda's compensation were unique to his recruitment to join Aptar. In particular, the amount of other compensation in 2017 for Mr.Tanda includes (i)payments for moving expenses of approximately $51,000, (ii)payments for legal expenses associated with the negotiation of his employment agreement of approximately $34,000 and (iii)compensation of approximately $1.128million related to long term incentive awards that were forfeited upon his resignation from his prior employer to join Aptar. If these recruitment amounts were excluded from Mr.Tanda's compensation for the pay ratio disclosure, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr.Tanda to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 131 to 1. This supplemental ratio should not be viewed as a substitute for the ratio noted above. 75 Table of Contents Identification of Median Employee We selected December31, 2017 as the date on which to determine our median employee. As of that date, we had had approximately 11,700 employees, with approximately 2,100 employees based in the United States and 9,600 employees located outside of the United States. We applied the allowed \"de minimis\" exception to exclude 566 employees in the following countries: Russia (82) Indonesia (140) and India (344). If we excluded any employees from a country using this de minimis exception, all employees from that country were excluded. After taking into account the de minimis exemption, approximately 2,100 employees in the United States and approximately 9,000 employees located outside of the United States were considered for identifying the median employee. For purposes of identifying the median employee from our employee population base, we considered the total cash compensation earned by our employees, as compiled from our payroll records. We selected total cash compensation as it reflects the principal forms of compensation delivered to all of our employees and this information is readily available in each country. In addition, we measured compensation for purposes of determining the median employee using the 12-month period ended December31, 2017. Compensation paid in foreign currencies was converted to U.S. dollars using the spot exchange rate at December31, 2017. In determining the annual total compensation of the median employee, such employee's compensation was calculated in accordance with Item402(c)(2)(x) of RegulationS-K, as required pursuant to the SEC executive compensation disclosure rules. The total compensation reported for Mr.Tanda differs from the Total column of the 2017 Summary Compensation Table as a result of the annualization of Mr.Tanda's compensation to reflect his February1, 2017 appointment to the position of President and CEO of Aptar. To annualize Mr.Tanda's compensation, we adjusted his salary by calculating it as if he was employed by Aptar for all of 2017. Because Mr.T\n",

FW Cook performed these services solely on behalf of the Committee.The Committee has assessed the independence of FW Cook, as required by the Company146s governance framework and Nasdaq and SEC rules, and has concluded that no conflict of interest exists with respect to its services to the Committee. Elements of the Compensation Program Base Salary Consistent with our desire to provide compensation that will attract and retain superior executives, when establishing base pay for our NEOs, our Committee considers both (i)the experience, skills and responsibilities of the NEO and (ii)the pay practices of companies with whom we compete for executives. When adjusting base salaries, the Committee also considers Company performance and an NEO146s individual performance.  25 Table of Contents As part of the 2017 compensation review process, the Committee decided not to increase the base salaries of our NEOs with the exception of Mr.Rehnberg, whose base salary was increased to $650,000 from $575,000 effective February19, 2017. The Committee decided to increase Mr.Rehnberg146s base salary by 13% given his performance and tenure without an increase in base salary since joining the Company in 2013. Annual Incentive Awards Our annual cash incentive compensation plan is structured to motivate and reward achievement of short-term financial goals and individual performance objectives and to provide a strong linkage between pay and performance. For our NEOs, annual incentive awards are determined based on an individual target award multiplied by the percentage of plan pre-tax operating income earned by the Company. This result is then subject to upward or downward adjustment by up to 30% if deemed appropriate by the Committee to factor in individual achievement of annual objectives:  Individual Target Award  x  %Achievementof Plan Pre-TaxOperatingIncome (as adjusted) -50% to +200%applied to targetawards  =  CalculatedPreliminary Award  +  IndividualPerformanceModifier +/- 30%applied topreliminaryaward)  =  IndividualFinal Award  At the beginning of the year, each NEO146s individual target award is established as a percentage of his or her base salary. At the end of the year, a pool is established based upon the Company146s pre-tax operating income for the year subject to a minimum achievement of at least 50% of plan, with a maximum funding opportunity of up to 200% of plan. Pre-tax operating income is defined as net income before taxes excluding non-recurring net realized investment gains and losses and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. The Committee has selected pre-tax operating income as a key financial metric because it believes it is the most accurate reflection of the Company146s short-term financial and operational performance. Since 2015, partly in recognition of the evolution of the Company146s investment strategy towards a total return objective, the Committee included in the plan the return on certain investments that had historically been recorded as net realized gains and losses. Achievement against plan includes the actual return on those investments. If the Company does not achieve 50% of plan pre-tax operating income for the year, the pool is not funded and no awards are paid at year-end. This minimum funding requirement is designed to align the interests of management with the interests of shareholders while not providing incentives for undue risk taking. When evaluating financial performance at the end of the year, the Committee may also consider the state of the insurance market, the state of the investment market, the impact of unusual catastrophic events, accounting changes or other factors affecting pre-tax operating income outside of management146s control, in adjusting the calculated preliminary award. For 2017, the Committee adjusted both plan and actual pre-tax operating income by eliminating the expense related to certain types of cash-settled equity awards that are directly impacted by a change in the Company146s stock price. At the beginning of the year, the Committee also establishes and communicates annual individual\n"

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Battat: For 2017, our Chief Executive Officer had total compensation of $4,315,721, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table at page 17 of this proxy statement. We determined that our median employee146s annual total compensation was $38,242 for 2017. As a result, our Chief Executive Officer146s annual total compensation for 2017 was approximately 113 times the annual total compensation of our median employee. We identified our median employee by examining the 2017 total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on December 31, 2017. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates in identifying the median employee or with respect to total cash compensation, and we did not annualize the compensation of any full-time employees who were not employed by us for all of 2017. We have elected to disclose a supplemental ratio that excludes the grant date fair value of the equity awards granted in 2017. Our Chief Executive Officer146s annual total compensation for 2017 includes $2,821,232 representing the grant date fair value of the restricted stock and stock options granted to him in 2017. We have generally made awards of this nature to our Chief Executive Officer at five year intervals and not annually, and none of the restricted stock or stock options granted to our Chief Executive Officer in 2017 has vested as of the date of this proxy statement. If the grant date fair value of the 2017 equity awards were excluded, our Chief Executive Officer146s annual total compensation for 2017 would have been approximately 39 times our median employee146s annual total compensation for 2017. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation During 2017, Messrs. Athey, Morgan, Spaulding, and Stupp served as members of the Compensation Committee. None of the members of the Compensation Committee was or had previously been an officer or employee of the Company or our subsidiaries or had any relationship requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Additionally, during 2017, none of our executive officers was a member of the board of directors, or any committee thereof, of any other entity one of the executive officers of which served as a member of our Board of Directors, or any committee thereof. 24 TABLE OF CONTENTS Item 2 160160160 RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Our Audit Committee has appointed the firm of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year 2018. Although ratification by stockholders of the selection of Grant Thornton LLP is not required by law, the selection of Grant Thornton LLP is being submitted to our stockholders for ratification because we believe it is a good corporate practice. If stockholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain Grant Thornton LLP. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interest of us and our stockholders. A representative of Grant Thornton LLP will attend the annual meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

The compensation for our CEO in1602017 was approximately 110 times the median pay of our full-time employees.160 Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with SEC rules (Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K). We identified the median employee by examining the1602017160total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 31,1602017, the last day of our payroll year. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. 160We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation, and we did not annualize the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of1602017. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual stock awards to employees. After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as160set forth in the1602017160Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement.EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATIONThe following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2017 regarding total shares subject to outstanding stock options, warrants and rights and total additional shares available for issuance under our existing equity compensation plans.

As a result of the flexibility permitted by Item 402(u), the method we used to determine our median employee may differ from the methods used by our peers, so the ratios may not be comparable. 160 32 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The members of the Compensation Committee are Michael M.

PROPOSAL 2 8211 ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to periodically include in our annual meeting proxy statements and present at the annual meeting of shareholders a non-binding shareholder resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in the proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.160 This proposal, commonly known as a \"say-on-pay\" proposal, gives shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the compensation of Banner's executives as disclosed in the Proxy Statement.160 At the 2013 annual meeting of shareholders, we were also required under the Dodd-Frank Act to include a non-binding shareholder resolution regarding the frequency of future votes on executive compensation.160 Shareholders voted in favor of holding an annual vote and the Board of Directors determined to hold an annual shareholder advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, beginning with the 2014 annual meeting of shareholders.160 We will continue to hold an annual vote until such time that the frequency vote is next presented to shareholders or until the Board determines that a different frequency is in the best interest of Banner.

      "PAY RATIO As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Curtis C. Simard, our Chief Executive Officer and President (our 8220CEO8221):For 2017, our last completed year:8226The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our Company other than our CEO was $46,610.8226The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table was $1,203,034.Based on this information for 2017, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Simard, our CEO, to the median of the total annual compensation of all employees was 1:26. To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO for this purpose, we took the following steps:160160160160a.We selected, November 15, 2017 which is within the last three months of 2017, as the date upon which we would identify the 8220median employee8221 because it enabled us to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner. b.To identify the 8220median employee8221 from our employee population, we included annualized base salary calculated on their November 15th32compensation rate, overtime, incentives, commissions, matching contributions to participants in our Section 401(k) plan, and the employer subsidy contributions for our health programs. c.In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of the employees who were hired in 2017, but did not work for us for the entire fiscal year. Since we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to our employees, such awards were excluded from our compensation measure for all employees with the exception of our CEO. We identified our median employee using compensation measures identified in (b) consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation, including our CEO. CEO Employment AgreementIn 2013, we entered into a written employment agreement with Mr. Simard, as President and CEO (8220the CEO Employment Agreement8221). The CEO Employment Agreement provides for the payment of an annual base salary to him of not less than $375,000 paid in substantially equal installments in accordance with our compensation policies and procedures on the pay dates established by us for our senior executive officers. 160He also participates in any short-term, long-term, or other performance compensation plans agreed upon by the parties during the term of the CEO Employment Agreement in concert with our evolving goals and objectives. The CEO Employment Agreement currently has a term of one year with automatic extensions of one year each in the absence of notice from us of our intention not to extend the term of the CEO Employment Agreement. The 2013 CEO Employment Agreement also provides for a lump sum payment of two times his salary plus medical, dental and vision benefits for Mr. Simard and his eligible dependents in the event Mr. Simard is involuntary terminated without cause or voluntarily terminated for good reason. This payment shall be reduced to a one times multiplier in the event the CEO Employment Agreement is not renewed. 160With limited exceptions, it also allows for a severance payment to him in the event his employment is terminated within one year prior to or following certain events defined to constitute a change in control of the Company. This severance payment resulting from a termination of employment (constructive termination) following a change in control is equal 45to two times his base annual salary, incentive compensation payments earned and any accrued but unused vacation time. 160In addition, if Mr. Simard had any unvested stock options/grants they would vest in accordance with the terms of the plans under which they were granted and vest fully upon a change in control. 160Any payments due him would be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that no portion of such payment will be non-deductible by us under Code Section 280G or will be subject to excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999.The 2013 CEO Employment Agreement also restricts Mr. Simard8217s ability to compete with us during the term and for a period of one year following the cessation of his employment with us regardless of reason within a 150-air mile radius from Bar Harbor, Maine.In February, 2018 the Company executed a new CEO Employment Agreement with Mr. Simard in order to retain Mr. Simard. This new agreement replaces Mr. Simard8217s 2013 agreement.The term of the Employment Agreement is three years from January 1, 2018, with automatic one-year renewals each January 1st thereafter unless the Employer elects not to extend the term of the Employment Agreement by\n",

      "Pay RatioThe Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay our executive officers receive and the pay all other employees receive. The Compensation Committee believes executive pay must be equitable to motivate our employees and to create shareholder value. The Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of CEO pay, to the pay of all other employees as of December 31, 2017.Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, as promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Using this methodology, the compensation for our CEO in 2017 was approximately 134:1 times the pay of our median employee.We identified the median employee by examining the 2017 W-2 compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December16031, 2017, the last day of our payroll year. As required by Regulation S-K, we included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation. We annualized the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for the entire fiscal year 2017 or who were on leave of absence during the fiscal year 2017 only. We did not annualize pay for those employees who worked less than full-time. We believe the use of total W-2 compensation for all employees is the most accurate and consistently applied compensation measure.After identifying the median employee based on total W-2 compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table earlier in this proxy statement. This calculation is illustrated in the table below:Compensation Component:160Chief Executive Officer160Median EmployeeSalary160$746,192160$21,121Stock Awards1601,008,3721608212Non-Equity Incentive Plan compensation1601,010,2401608212All other compensation16064,4571608212Total 160$2,829,261160$21,121Approximately 52% of our employee base are adjunct faculty and work part time.

Representatives of Deloitte are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement should they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.Although our bylaws do not require that our stockholders approve the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, the Board is submitting the selection of Deloitte to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If our stockholders vote against the ratification of Deloitte, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to continue to retain the firm. Even if our stockholders ratify the appointment of Deloitte, the Audit Committee may choose to appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders.Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees and ServicesThe following table presents fees for professional audit and other services rendered by Deloitte for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December16031, 201732and 2016, respectively, and fees billed for other services rendered by Deloitte during those respective periods.16020171602016Audit Fees (1)$2,365,559160$2,343,080Audit8209Related Fees (2)310,5701608212Tax Fees (3)30,08216051,960All Other Fees (4)4,1671602,000Total$2,710,378160$2,397,040(1)Audit Fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for 201732and 201632for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements and the review of consolidated financial statements included in our quarterly reports, or professional services rendered in connection with our filing of various registration statements or otherwise normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.(2)Audit-Related Fees consist of the aggregate fees billed in 201732and 201632for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees.

      "PAY RATIO As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are providing disclosure regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr.Burdiek, our CEO, to the median of the total annual compensation of our employees other than Mr.Burdiek. We identified our employee with the median annual compensation using total cash compensation for calendar year 2017 of all employees who were employed by us on December31, 2017, at which date our global workforce consisted of 838 employees, of which 752 were U.S. employees and 86 were non-U.S. employees. In calculating the median compensated employee we excluded our employees in Canada (4), Ireland (5), New Zealand (4)and the United Kingdom (5) (a total of 18 individuals which represents 2.1% of our global workforce, who were excluded pursuant to the de minimis exemption of Item 402(u) of the SEC146s rules). As a result, we determined our median compensated employee based on 820 employees. We did not include any contractors or other non-employee workers in our employee population. We annualized the compensation for any full-time and part-time employees who commenced work during calendar 2017. We believe total cash compensation for all employees is reasonable to use as a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not have a broad based equity award plan. We selected December31, 2017, which is within the last three months of our fiscal 2018, for the date as of when we would identify the employee with the median annual compensation, because it enabled us to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner. After identifying the employee with the median total cash compensation for the 12 months ended December31, 2017, we calculated total compensation for this employee for the fiscal year ended February28, 2018 using the same methodology that we use for our NEOs in the Summary Compensation Table shown on page 34 of this proxy statement. For fiscal 2018, the total compensation of our CEO was $2.9million and the total compensation of our employee with median annual compensation was $68,250. Accordingly, we estimated our CEO Pay Ratio for fiscal 2018 to be 42 to 1.

Kropelnicki. The 2017 annual total compensation of the median compensated of all our employees who were employed on December30, 2017, other than our Presidentamp CEO, was $127,258 Mr.Kropelnicki's 2017 annual total compensation was $7,839,716, inclusive of $4,990,347 which as previously disclosed represents the estimated present value changes in the actuarial projections of his future potential pension benefits under the groups authorized retirement plans the ratio of these amounts was 1-to-62. Actual benefits earned are contingent upon a number of factors including years of service, age at retirement, expected life mortality tables, interest rates, and service level vesting requirements. Excluding the $4,990,347 estimated change in present value of the actuarially projected pension benefits, the 2017 annual total compensation of both Mr.Kropelnicki's and our median compensated employee would result in 2017 annual compensation of $2,849,367 and $88,243 respectively, the ratio of these amounts was 1-to-32. The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. The pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. For these purposes, we identified the median compensated employee by first including full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees, excluding the Presidentamp CEO, for a total of 1,178 employees in the median compensation pool. We used actual salary and compensation paid in 2017, as reflected in our payroll records, excluding equity awards and bonus payments as these are not broadly distributed, to determine the median employee. We then calculated the median employee's total compensation in accordance with SEC rules to determine the pay ratio.

      "Pay Ratio As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of the Securities and Exchange Commission8217s Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. John Cato, our Chief Executive Officer. The pay ratio included below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median-compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee8217s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the amount of compensation of the median-compensated employee and the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to our estimates reported below, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. For our fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 (8220fiscal 20178221) the total compensation of the Company8217s Chief Executive Officer of $2,802,436, as presented in the Summary Compensation Table, was approximately 289 times the total compensation of the Company8217s median employee of $9,682 calculated in the same manner. The median employee is a part-time employee and was identified by reviewing the total cash compensation for all employees, excluding the Company8217s Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by the Company on December 31, 2017. All of the Company8217s employees were included, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis. Adjustments were made to annualize the compensation of employees who were not employed by the Company for the entire year. After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, the 2017 annual total compensation was calculated for the median employee using the same methodology used for the Company8217s Chief Executive Officer as presented in the Summary Compensation Table. As additional information, the total compensation of the Company8217s Chief Executive Officer was approximately 82 times the total compensation of the Company8217s median full-time employee of $34,314 calculated in the same manner as the Chief Executive Officer8217s total compensation. The median full-time employee is a store manager and was identified by reviewing the total cash compensation for all full-time employees, excluding the Company8217s Chief Executive Officer, who were employed on a full-time basis for the entire year. 36 FISCAL YEAR 2017 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION Change in Pension Fees Earned Stock Value and Nonqualified or Paid Awards Deferred Compensation All Other in Cash ($) Earnings Compensation Total Name   ($)  (1),(2)  ($)  ($)  ($) Thomas B.

      "Pay Ratio Information160160160160160Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we have included below a disclosure of the ratio of the median employee8217s annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Neidorff. Because the applicable SEC rules allow companies to use a variety of methods to determine this ratio, the ratio disclosed by the Company may not be comparable to the ratio disclosed by other companies.Mr. Neidorff's annual total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $25,269,468, which reflects the amount reported in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement plus $10,00032of the company-paid portion of Mr. Neidorff8217s medical plan premiums. The annual total compensation for the median employee for the year ending December 31, 2017 was $66,600, inclusive of the company-paid portion of the medical plan premiums. Mr. Neidorff's annual total compensation was 37932times that of our median employee's pay.In determining the median employee, we examined total cash compensation (i.e. base wages plus short-term incentive payments) for individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by the company as of December 31, 2017. During this analysis, the compensation for employees hired during the year was annualized. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or temporary basis, except approximately 505 employees in the United Kingdom which were excluded under the de minimis exemption and 231 employees related to an acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2017. This resulted in 33,312 employees being included in our median employee calculation. After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation of the employee using the same methodology used for our NEOs within the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement, plus company-paid medical plan premiums capped at $10,000.52323232Centene Corporation Table of Contents2018 NOTICE OF MEETING AND PROXY STATEMENTOTHER MATTERS160160160160160Other Matters160160160160160160160Information About Stock OwnershipThe following table sets forth information regarding beneficial ownership of our common stock as of February16023, 2018, for: 8226each person, entity or group of affiliated persons or entities known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock8226each of our NEOs and directors (three of whom are nominated for re-election or election) and8226all of our executive officers and directors as a group.Name and Address of Beneficial OwnerAmount and Nature of Beneficial OwnershipOutstandingSharesSharesAcquirableWithin16060160DaysTotalBeneficialOwnershipPercentof ClassThe Vanguard Group, Inc.18,123,190160821216018,123,19016010.4100 Vanguard Blvd.Malvern, Pennsylvania 19355160160160160160160160BlackRock, Inc.13,939,406160821216013,939,4061608.055 East 52nd StreetNew York, New York 10055160160160160160160160T.

      "Pay Ratio DisclosureAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Bless, our CEO, to the annual total compensation of our median employee. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.The values for 2017, our last completed fiscal year, are as follows:8226annual total compensation for our CEO, as reported in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table on page 3232of this proxy statement was 4,429,3378226annual total compensation for our median employee was $114,7858226ratio of Mr. Bless' annual total compensation to our medial employee's total compensation 8212 39:1.In determining our 8220median employee,8221 we examined 2016 taxable compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on November 1, 2017. We included all employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis whether located in the U.S. or abroad and without regard to whether the employees are salaried or hourly. We did not make any material assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to taxable compensation or in identifying the median employee, and we did not annualize the compensation for any full-time or permanent part-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2016. We believe the use of annual taxable compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure. After identifying the median employee based on 2016 taxable compensation, we calculated 2017 annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use to calculate the total compensation of our CEO as reported in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table later in this proxy statement.The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and in calculating the pay ratio allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, exclusions and assumptions. As such, the pay ratio reported above may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director IndependenceRelated Person Transaction PolicyThe Company has a written policy and written procedures for the review, approval and monitoring of transactions involving Century or its subsidiaries and 8220related persons.8221 For the purposes of the policy, \"related persons\" include executive officers, directors and director nominees and their immediate family members, and stockholders owning five percent or greater of our outstanding stock and their family members. A copy of the Company's Related Person Transaction Policy is available in the Investor section of the Company's website, www.centuryaluminum.com, under the tab 8220Corporate Governance.8221The Company's Related Person Transaction Policy applies to all related person transactions entered into after its adoption. This policy applies, subject to certain specific exclusions, to any transaction, arrangement or relationship or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships in which Century or any of its subsidiaries was or is to be a participant and where any related person had or will have a direct or indirect interest. Pursuant to the policy, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing related person transactions. However, all transactions with Glencore and any other transaction the Audit Committee Chair determines is material to the Company are reviewed by the independent directors, acting as a separate body of our Board. Based on its consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, whether the transaction is on terms that are fair and reasonable to Century and whether the transaction is in the business interests of Century, the Audit Committee or independent directors, as the case may be, will decide whether or not to approve or ratify such transaction. If a related person transaction is submitted for approval after the commencement of the transaction, the Audit Committee or independent directors, as the case may be, will evaluate all options available, including the ratification, rescission or termination of such transaction, if appropriate. The policy defines certain ordinary course, non-material transactions with Glencore that are pre-approved by the independent directors. The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports of all pre-approved transactions.40Table of ContentsRecent Related Party Transactions with GlencoreApproval of Transactions with GlencoreAll transactions with Glencore, our largest stockholder, are subject to our Related Person Transaction Policy described above and are approved by the Audit Committee or by a special committee comprised solely of independent directors.Sales to GlencoreFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived approximately16075%160of our consolida\n",

      "PAY RATIO Under SEC rules, we are required to disclose the ratio of our CEO146s annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our Company146s median employee (147CEO Pay Ratio148). Mr.Greenman146s total compensation for 2017 was $2.1million as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table. Our median employee146s annual total compensation was $141,249. As a result, the ratio of these amounts was 15:1. The median of the annual total compensation for all our employees (excluding the CEO) was determined through the following process:   149  We identified the global employee population active as of September30, 2017. This included all full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal workers.   149  To identify the median employee, we used the following consistently applied compensation measure for 2017: salary, target annual cash incentive, commission, and grant date fair value of long-term incentive awards. For regular full-time and part-time employees (other than temporary, seasonal or other non-permanent employees) who were not employed for the full year 2017, compensation was annualized. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to our pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may use different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.  53 Table of Contents DIRECTOR COMPENSATION The Compensation Committee reviews director compensation on a periodic basis. In late 2015, the Compensation Committee engaged Radford Consulting to provide an assessment of the compensation of our Board. Based on that assessment, the Board made no changes to the then-current cash compensation arrangements for our directors, as further described below. However, the equity component of our director compensation program, which provides for the automatic grant of equity awards on the date of each our annual meetings, was modified in 2016 to provide each continuing director with an annual grant with a total value of $115,000, divided equally between stock options and RSUs, with the exception of our Chair, who would receive a grant with a total value of $140,000, divided equally between stock options and RSUs. For 2017, however, based on data provided by Radford Consulting in connection with their 2017 engagement, our Board reduced the aggregate value of the annual grants for continuing directors from $115,000 to $100,000 and from $140,000 to $125,000 for the Chair of our Board, still divided equally between stock options and RSUs. The new values generally approximated the 50thpercentile of our then peer group. The number of shares subject to each award is determined by dividing the target dollar value by (a)in the case of stock options, the Black-Scholes value of a stock option share, determined using our average closing stock price for the 30 trading days preceding the grant date, and (b)in the case of RSUs, our average closing stock price for the 30 trading days preceding the grant date. As a result, each of ournon-employeedirectors received anon-qualifiedstock option grant covering 38,005 shares of our common stock, or 47,507 shares in the case of the Chair of the Board, and an RSU grant covering 15,853 shares, or 19,816 shares in the case of the Chair of the Board, on the date of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. These equity grants were made pursuant to the terms of the 2008 Plan. Stock options granted to our directors had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and a term of ten years. Under our director compensation program, the automatic annual stock option grants vest in twelve equal monthly installments following the date of grant, provided that the final vesting date will be the earlier of the first anniversary of the date of grant or the day prior to the next annual meeting, subject to the director146s continuous service with us through the applicable vesting date. 100% of the shares subject toautomatic annual RSUgrants veston the earlier of the first anniversary of the date of grant or the day prior to the next annual meeting,subject to the director146s continuous service with us through the vest date.

      "Pay Ratio We believe our executive compensation program must be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our employees to create stockholder value. We monitor the relationship between the compensation of our executive officers and the compensation of our non-managerial employees. For 2017, the total cash compensation, of Gideon Wertheizer, our Chief Executive Officer of $1,505,491, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table above, was approximately 12.2 times the total cash compensation of a median employee calculated in the same manner of $123,733. Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with SEC146s rules pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December31, 2017, the last day of our payroll year. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time or part-time. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation. We annualized the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2017. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees. Employment Agreements On November1, 2002, we entered into employment agreements, as amended, with Messrs. Wertheizer and Ohana. Although each employment agreement is for an indefinite term, the employment of each of Messrs. Wertheizer and Ohana will be terminable at any time by us, other than for cause, upon the determination of our board of directors with not less than 30 days146 notice or by the individual with notice of not less than nine months in the case of Mr.Wertheizer and six months in the case of Mr.Ohana. If our board of directors determines that a termination of employment is based on the failure by either Messrs. Wertheizer or Ohana, as applicable, to perform his reasonably assigned duties, we are required to give notice or a cure period of not less than nine months in the case of Mr.Wertheizer and six months in the case of Mr.Ohana prior to termination. In the event of termination of employment (i)by us without cause, (ii)by either of Messrs. Wertheizer or Ohana for good reason (provided he gives notice to us and provides us with a cure period to correct the basis for the good reason termination), or (iii)by us or an acquiring or succeeding corporation after a change in control of our company, other than for cause, within 12 months after the change in control event, then either of Messrs. Wertheizer or Ohana, as applicable, would be entitled to the compensation, including medical and, to the extent applicable, pension benefits, to which he would otherwise have been entitled had he remained employed by us for two years, and his options will vest in full provided, that the provision of any such benefits is contingent upon the execution by either of Messrs. Wertheizer or Ohana, as applicable, a release in a form reasonably acceptable to us. If either of Messrs. Wertheizer or Ohana terminates his employment with us without good reason but after the provision of prior notice in accordance with the notice period requirements, irrespective of the date of the termination of actual employment, he would be entitled to compensation and benefits through the end of the notice period which is nine months in the case of Mr.Wertheizer and six months in the case of Mr.Ohana. If the employment of either of Messrs. Wertheizer or Ohana is terminated by death, his options will vest in full.  28 On August18, 2005, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr.Arieli. Upon the termination of his employment, Mr.Arieli will be entitled to severance benefits in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel. The employment agreement was effective as of August1, 2005 and shall continue in effect until terminated in accordance with its terms. The employment of Mr.Arieli may be terminable at any time by either party and for any reason with six months prior written notice. If we terminate Mr.Arieli146s employment without providing the requisite notice period, Mr.Arieli will be entitled to an amount equal to six months of his then applicable monthly base salary. In May 2007, to provide consistency with the employment agreements of Messrs. Wertheizer and Ohana, our board of directors determined that if Mr.Arieli resigns for good reason or if the company, or an acquiring or succeeding corporation after a change in control of our company, terminates him, other than for cause, within 12 months after the change in control event, then Mr.Arieli146s then outstanding options would vest in full.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE  As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are providing the ratio of the total annual compensation of our CEO, John J. Sperzel III, to that of the median employee for 2017. The compensation for our CEO in 2017 was approximately 13 times the median pay of our employees.  Our CEO-to-median-employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with what the SEC requires pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who  19   were employed by us on December 31, 2017, the last day of our payroll year. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation, and we did not annualize the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2017. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees.  After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers asset forth in the ldquoExecutive Compensation Tablerdquo above.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  Executive Summary  Named Executive Officers. The following persons are referred to herein as the quotNamed Executive Officersquot or quotNEOsquot: John J. Sperzel III, who served as the Company's CEO during fiscal 2017, Neil A. Goldman, who became the Company's Chief Financial Officer on December 18, 2017, Javan Esfandiari, Sharon Klugewicz, Robert Passas, and Richard J. Larkin, who served as the Companyrsquos Chief Financial Officer in 2017 until his retirement on December 18, 2017.  Biographical information concerning each of our NEOs is included above in this Proxy Statement under quotINFORMATION REGARDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERSquot.  Compensation Philosophy and Objectives. Our policies regarding executive compensation programs are intended to balance motivating, rewarding and retaining executives with a competitive compensation package, and maximizing long-term stockholder value by linking compensation earned to both individual and Company performance. Compensation typically includes base salary, eligibility for annual cash bonuses and equity-based awards, retirement plan contributions, and other Company-sponsored benefits. A significant portion of each NEO's cash bonus and equity-based awards are dependent upon the Company's and/or the individual's achieving business and financial goals and realizing other performance objectives. Examples of Company performance metrics for which we measure achievement are net revenue, gross profit, profit margins, operating income, and net earnings, as well as achievements and other developments in the Company's business operations (such as product development, regulatory approval and/or marketing launch, new customer contracts, etc.). Annual performance targets for these metrics are set after consideration of the Company's strategic plan,historical results, and other factors. Our compensation programs are intended to reward individual contributions (for example, bringing a new product to market) and Company-wide achievement of performance metric targets (for example, overall revenue and net earnings).  The Compensation Committee is responsible for ongoing oversight of compliance with this compensation philosophy. The Compensation Committee strives to ensure that, in its judgment, the total compensation paid to the NEOs is fair, reasonable and competitive.  At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, we once again held an advisory, quotsay-on-payquot vote on the compensation of our NEOs. At that time, our stockholders approved the compensation of our NEOs, with approximately 95.6% of votes cast in favor of the prior year's compensation of our NEOs. Based on the strong stockholder support from the 2017 say-on-pay vote, the Compensation Committee concluded that stockholders were confirming their concurrence with the compensation paid to the NEOs and that the stockholders did not believe that the Compensation Committee needed to make substantial revisions to the compensation of the Company's NEOs.  Establishing Compensation Levels. Compensation levels for the NEOs are driven by market pay levels, the NEO's individual achievement and leadership performance, and overall Company performance. The Compensation Committee relies upon a combination of judgment (which is necessarily subj\n"

We identified the median employee using the annual base salary and expected bonus, as of December 31, 2017, plus any incentive stock awards granted in 2017 for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on December 31, 2017, the last day of our payroll year (whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis). After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our CEO Compensation. The CEO pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on the methodologies and assumptions described above. SEC rules for identifying the median employee and determining the CEO pay ratio permit companies to employ a wide range of methodologies, estimates and assumptions. As a result, the CEO pay ratios reported by other companies, which may have employed other permitted methodologies or assumptions and which may have a significantly different work force structure from ours, may not be comparable to our CEO pay ratio. EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION We have adopted an equity incentive plan to provide incentives to our independent directors, employees, and other service providers to stimulate their efforts toward our continued success, long-term growth and profitability and to attract, reward and retain personnel. 39 Table of Contents The following table provides information as of December 31, 2017 concerning shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under our existing equity incentive plan.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION Our compensation committee is comprised solely of the following independent directors: Messrs. Keenan (Chair), Reilly, Creagh and Ms. Bazemore. None of them is serving or has served as an officer or employee of us or any affiliate or has any other business relationship or affiliation with us, except his service as a director, and there are no other Compensation Committee interlocks that are required to be reported under the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS We compensate only those directors who are independent under the NYSE listing standards. Any member of our Board of Directors who is an employee of ours is not considered independent under the NYSE listing standards and did not (nor will not) receive additional compensation for serving on our Board of Directors. Our compensation committee, together with FW Cook, a nationally-recognized compensation consulting firm, reviews the components of the compensation arrangements offered to our independent directors. As part of this process, our compensation committee considers, among other things, the duties and responsibilities associated with the position of each director and emerging trends and best practices in director compensation. Based upon the recommendations of FW Cook and our compensation committee8217s review of FW Cook8217s analysis, our compensation committee recommended to our full Board of Directors, and our Board of Directors approved, the following compensation arrangements offered to our independent directors, effective for the 2017 calendar year: (i) a cash retainer of $100,000 (which the independent directors may elect to receive in shares of our common stock in lieu of cash), the cash component is payable quarterly in equal installments and the stock component, if any, is granted annually, (ii) an annual equity grant of $100,000, (iii) a non-executive Chairperson of the Board of Directors retainer of $50,000 (iv) an Audit Committee Chairperson retainer of $25,000, (v) a Compensation Committee Chairperson retainer of $20,000, (vi) a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chairperson retainer of $15,000, and (v\n",

      "Pay Ratio As a result of a rule adopted by the SEC in 2015, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the 147Dodd-Frank Act148), beginning with its 2018 proxy statement, the Corporation is required to disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of the Corporation146s CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of the Corporation146s employees (except for the CEO).  23 For the fiscal year ended December31, 2017, the Corporation performed a calculation of its CEO to median employee pay ratio in accordance with Item 402(u) of SEC Regulation S-K. The Corporation identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total cash compensation for all employees, excluding the CEO, who were employed by the Corporation as of December31, 2017. It included all employees, including those employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis, and did not annualize the compensation for any employees who were not employed by the Corporation for all of 2017. After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, the Corporation calculated the total compensation for the median employee using the same methodology used for the CEO and other NEOs as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for 2017 included in this Proxy Statement. Using the methodology described above, the Corporation estimates that the 2017 annual total compensation of the CEO, James E. Miller, in the amount of $848,265 was approximately 22 times the median employee146s 2017 annual total compensation of $38,818.

      "pay ratio disclosures that were required to be included in this proxy statement. Meridian reported directly to the ECC and carried out its responsibilities as assigned by the ECC. The ECC reviewed Meridian relative to the NASDAQ independence standards and determined Meridian to be independent with no conflicts of interest identified. The Role of Management At the request of the ECC, NEOs of the Corporation may be present at ECC meetings for discussion purposes, except that the Presidentamp CEO may not be present during any voting or deliberations of the ECC concerning his compensation. Other NEOs are also not present during deliberations on their compensation. The NEOs have no involvement in the decisions made by the ECC, nor do they have a vote on any matters brought before the ECC. The ECC meets with the Presidentamp CEO to discuss his input on performance and compensation recommendations for his reports, but ultimately decisions regarding other NEOs are made solely based upon the ECC146s deliberations. The ECC considers feedback from the Presidentamp CEO, as well as input from the compensation consultant as requested, to make decisions regarding the compensation of the Presidentamp CEO. Competitive Benchmarking On an annual basis, the ECC reviews competitive market data and conducts a comprehensive compensation assessment. To assist in making compensation decisions in 2017, Meridian was engaged by the ECC to conduct a comprehensive review of our NEO total compensation program. The purpose of the review was to provide an independent and objective analysis of all elements of compensation (individually and in aggregate) relative to market and peer group practices. An assessment of the pay mix and the pay for performance relationship were also presented to the ECC. The primary data source used in examining the competitive market for the NEOs is information publicly disclosed by a peer group of other publicly traded financial corporations. A peer group was developed by Meridian using objective parameters that reflect banks of similar size, geographic region, and business model (factors that influence NEO compensation in banks). Meridian excluded banks in large metropolitan areas as they are not similar to the Corporation. The peer group was approved by the ECC. Peer groups are reviewed and updated as appropriate, since the comparable banks may change depending on acquisitions and business focus of the bank or our peer institutions. Overall, the goal is to have 15 to 25 comparative financial corporations that approximate our asset size and region and provide a market perspective for NEO total compensation.  15 The following 15 financial institutions comprise the peer group used in the 2017 review:  American National Bankshares, Inc.  Financial Institutions, Inc.  Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. Arrow Financial Corporation  First Community Bancshares, Inc.  Sun Bancorp, Inc. Chemung Financial Corporation  Old Line Bancshares, Inc.  Univest Corporation of Pennsylvania City Holding Company  Peoples Bancorp, Inc.  WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc. Farmers National Banc Corp.  Peoples Financial Services Corp.  Xenith Bankshares, Inc. In addition to the peer group data, the consultant used industry survey sources as part of the benchmarking process. The data reflected banks representing similar asset size and region to the Corporation. In the fall of 2017, the ECC engaged Meridian to conduct a comprehensive competitive analysis to assess the competitiveness of the total compensation program as a reference for setting its 2017 compensation program, developing the CEO long-term incentive program as well as to assess the historical pay for performance relationship. This analysis was also conducted in the fall of 2017 and was used for 2018 program decisions and as a basis for developing the NEO performance based LTI program. 2017 Compensation Program and Pay Decisions The Corporation146s compensation program consists of four elements: base salary, annual incentives, long-term /stock-based compensation, and benefits. The following section summarizes the role of each element, how decisions are made and the resulting 2017 decision process as it relates to our NEOs. Base Salary The Corporation believes that a competitive base salary is essential to hire and retain NEOs and that it should provide competitive fixed pay related to the role and contribution of the executive Our compensation consultant provides competitive market data based on its competitive assessment considering a composite of market data from the custom proxy peer group as well as other data sources of banking compensation information. The ECC uses this data to provide reference for making base salary decisions for each NEO. The ECC targets market median but\n",

In determining the median employee, CNX selected December 1, 2017 as its determination date, which date is within the last three months of CNXrsquos last completed fiscal year. As of this date, CNX employed 562 persons.  We have determined the 2017 annual total compensation of our median employee to be $129,390. The median employee is a full-time, salaried employee who was selected using base salary and cash bonus payout under the STIC, which were applied consistently across CNXrsquos entire employee population for the trailing 12-month period preceding December 1, 2017. We believe that these elements reasonably reflect the annual compensation of our general employee population. In determining the median employee, CNX did not use any of the exemptions permitted under SEC rules. Similarly, CNX did not rely on any material assumptions, adjustments or estimates in order to identify the median employee or to determine annual total compensation or any elements of annual total compensation for that employee or Mr. DeIuliis.  After identifying the median employee, CNX calculated the median employeersquos annual total compensation, as described above, for purposes of developing the comparison of Mr. DeIuliisrsquo annual total compensation to such median employeersquos annual total compensation.  -2018 Proxy Statement66 Back to Contents  ACCOUNTANTS AND AUDIT COMMITTEE  Audit Committee Report  The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management of CNX and Ernst amp Young LLP (ldquoEYrdquo), the independent registered public accounting firm serving as the independent auditor of the Corporation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the audited financial statements of the Corporation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the ldquoAudited Financial Statementsrdquo). In addition, we have discussed with EY the matters required to be discussed relating to the conduct of the audit under the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (ldquoPCAOBrdquo) (Auditing Standard No. 1301 ndash Communications with Audit Committees) relating to the conduct of the audit, including any difficulties encountered in the course of the audit work, any restrictions on the scope of the registered public accountantrsquos activities or access to requested information and any significant disagreements with management.  The Audit Committee also has received the written disclosures and the letter from EY required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountantrsquos communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with that firm its independence from the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The committee also discussed with management of the Corporation and EY such other matters and received such assurances from them as the Committee deemed appropriate.  Management is responsible for the Corporationrsquos internal controls and the financial reporting process. EY is responsible for performing an independent audit of CNXrsquos financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and issuing reports thereon. The Audit Committeersquos responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.  Based on the foregoing review and discussions with management and a review of the report of EY with respect to the Audited Financial Statements and the other matters described above, and relying thereon, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board the inclusion of the Audited Financial Statements in the Corporationrsquos Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for filing with the SEC.

For 2017, our last completed fiscal year, the total compensation in 2017 of our CEO was approximately 26 times the median total compensation in 2017 of all of our other employees (the 147Pay Ratio148). The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our Company (other than our CEO) was $129,482 and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $3,377,198, as included in the 147Summary Compensation Table148 above. The Company chose December 31, 2017 as the date for establishing the employee population used in identifying the median employee and used the 12 month period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 as the measurement period. We identified the median employee using the consistently applied compensation measure of base salary earned during the measurement period for each employee (U.S. and non-U.S.). Permanent employees who joined in 2017 and permanent employees who were on leave during 2017 were assumed to have worked for the entire measurement period. We captured all employees as of December 31, 2017, consisting of approximately 101 individuals globally, with approximately 98% of these individuals located in the U.S. and approximately 2% located outside of the U.S. Earnings of our employees outside the U.S. were converted to U.S. dollars using an average currency exchange rate over the measurement period.

      "Pay Ratio As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO. For 2017, our last completed fiscal year, the total compensation in 2017 of our CEO was approximately 9.7 times the median total compensation in 2017 of all of our other employees. The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our Company (other than our CEO) was $274,049 and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $2,661,292, as included in the 147Summary Compensation Table148 above. The Company chose December31, 2017 as the date for establishing the employee population used in identifying the median employee and used 2017 as the measurement period. We identified the median employee using a consistently applied compensation measure equal to the sum of (i)the annual base salary in effect as of December31, 2017 for all permanent employees and all base salary earned during 2017 for all temporary employees and (ii)the target bonus as of December31, 2017 for all employees. We captured all U.S. employees as of December31, 2017, consisting of approximately 122 individuals. We excluded the Company146s one non-U.S. employee, who is an employee of our subsidiary in Russia. Our median employee initially identified with this methodology was an employee hired during 2017, who therefore had anomalous compensation (base salary for a partial year, a prorated annual cash bonus and a new-hire equity award that was larger than would have been awarded on an annual basis). We therefore substituted this employee with a comparable employee who was employed for the entire year with substantially similar annual target compensation and whose rank was one greater than the original median employee on the basis of our consistently applied compensation measure. The annual total compensation of the median employee and the annual total compensation of the CEO were calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.  38 Table of Contents Compensation Risk Assessment Consistent with the SEC146s disclosure requirements, we have assessed our compensation programs for all employees. We have concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. Management has evaluated our executive and employee compensation and benefits programs to determine if these programs146 provisions and operations create undesired or unintentional risk of a material nature. The risk assessment process includes a review of program policies and practices analysis to identify risks and risk controls related to our compensation programs and determinations as to the sufficiency of risk identification, the balance of potential risk to potential reward, the effectiveness of our risk controls and the impacts of our compensation programs and their risks to our strategy. Although we periodically review all compensation programs, we focus on the programs with variability of payout, with the ability of a participant to directly affect payout and the controls on participant action and payout. In relation to this, we believe that our incentive compensation arrangements provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond our ability to effectively identify and manage significant risks and are compatible with effective internal controls and our risk management practices. The Compensation Committee monitors our compensation programs on an annual basis and expects to make modifications as necessary to address any changes in our business or risk profile.  39 Table of Contents EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION The following table provides certain information as of December31, 2017, regarding existing compensation plans, under which equity securities of the Company are authorized for issuance.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE  As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our median compensated associate and the annual total compensation of Mr. Matthew Trerotola, our President amp Chief Executive Officer. The pay ratio included in this section is a reasonable estimate calculated in a matter consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.  For 2017:  9632 The annual total compensation of the median compensated of all of our employees (other than our CEO) was $36,238 and   9632 The annual total compensation of Mr. Trerotola, as presented in the Summary Compensation Table, was $3,277,107.  Based on this information, for 2017 the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Trerotola, our Chief Executive Officer, to the annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was 90.4 to one.  The SECrsquos rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employeersquos annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.  To identify our median-compensated employee, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of this ldquomedian employeerdquo:  9632 We determined that, as of December 31, 2017, our employee population consisted of approximately 14,300 persons, of whom approximately 2,500 were employed in the United States and approximately 11,800 were employed outside the United States, based on our payroll records   9632 We selected December 31, 2017 as the date upon which we would identify the ldquomedian employeerdquo given the closing of the sale of our Fluid Handling business in December, in order to present a contemporaneous view as to the ldquomedian employeerdquo following this transaction   9632 We excluded approximately 1,100 employees from our acquisition of STE, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2017   9632 We annualized the compensation of associates employed by us for less than a full fiscal year   9632 Based on payroll data for all employees aside from those noted as excluded above, we used annualized base salary or base pay rate to identify our median employee, who was a full-time, salaried associate in Asia and   9632 Once the median employee was identified, we calculated the elements of this employeersquos compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-X, resulting in annual total compensation of $36,238 based on the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2017.  -2018Proxy Statement 47  Back to Contents EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION  The following table summarizes Colfax Corporationrsquos equity plan information as of December 31, 2017.

      "PAY RATIOWe are required by SEC rules adopted under Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, to disclose the ratio of our median employee8217s annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our principal executive officer. During fiscal 2017, the principal executive officer of the Company was our President and Chief Executive Officer, Curt Hartman. For 2017, Mr. Hartman8217s total annual compensation was $3,002,36432and for our median employee was approximately $25,624 resulting in an estimated pay ratio of 117:1. We identified the median employee by using all 3,492 active employees and contractors of the Company and its 52Table of Contentsconsolidated subsidiaries (excluding Mr. Hartman) as of November 1, 2017, whether employed full-time, part-time or on a contractual basis. For individuals hired prior to December 31, 2016, we used each applicable individual's taxable earnings as of December 31, 2016. For individuals hired after December 31, 2016, we used each applicable individual's non-annualized taxable earnings as of November 1, 2017 (the median employee determination date). Taxable earnings consisted of (A) base salary, (B) the target bonus, commission and/or management bonus paid during the period, (C) the estimated accounting value of any equity awards granted during the period, (D) other miscellaneous compensation items. Where applicable, currency of earnings was converted to U.S. dollars using an exchange rate as of our determination date.After identifying our median employee, who is located in the U.S., in accordance with SEC rules we calculated 2017 annual total compensation for both the median employee and Mr. Hartman using the same methodology that we use to determine our NEOs8217 annual total compensation for the Summary Compensation Table.The pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our internal records and the methodology described above. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee8217s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONSThe Company8217s Board of Directors, which is presently composed of David Bronson, Brian P. Concannon, Charles M. Farkas, Martha Goldberg Aronson, Jo Ann Golden, Curt R. Hartman, Dirk M. Kuyper, Jerome J. Lande, Mark E. Tryniski and John L. Workman, establishes the compensation plans and specific compensation levels for Mr. Hartman and for other executive officers through the Compensation Committee, and administers the Company8217s equity incentive plans through the Compensation Committee.In March 2003, the Audit Committee adopted a written charter specifying that it would pre-approve all transactions in which the Company is a participant and in which a related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest, including without limitation any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, other than related party transactions to any person or entity that are, individually or in the aggregate on an annual basis, less than $5,000. The charter requirement was incorporated into a policy in November 2003 under which requests for pre-approvals can be submitted to the Chair of the Audit Committee for pre-approval, with the Chair to report any such pre-approvals at the next scheduled meeting of the Audit Committee. Under the policy, such related-person transactions as further defined in the Company8217s related-party policy must be approved or ratified by the Audit Committee. Further, any related-party transaction in which the projected spending is over $50,000 requires management to secure competitive bids to ensure that any proposal is reasonable with respect to costs. The Committee may also determine that the approval or ratification of such transaction should be considered by all of the disinterested members of the Board. Related persons include any of our directors or executive officers and their family members.In considering whether to approve or ratify any related-person transaction, the chair or Committee, as applicable, may consider all factors that they deem relevant to the transaction, including, but n\n"

      "Pay Ratio, considerations under Section162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and an update on recent CEO Compensation changes made for 2018.  You should review this Compensation Discussion and Analysis section together with the tabular disclosures beginning on page 39.  Executive Compensation Objectives  The compensation committee has designed the Companyrsquos executive compensation program to achieve the following objectives:  middotprovide incentives to Company executives to maximize stockholder return  middotenable the Company to attract and retain talented, results-oriented managers capable of leading key areas of the Companyrsquos businessand  middotreward the management team for achieving key financial and operational objectives which will promote the long-term viability and success of the business.  The compensation committee intends that each key element of our total compensation plan serves specific purposes that help achieve the objectives of the Companyrsquos executive compensation program.  The three key elements of the current executive compensation program are (1) annual base salary, (2) annual cash bonuses (sometimes referred to as short term incentive, or ldquoSTIrdquo), and (3) long-term, equity-based incentives (sometimes referred to as ldquoLTIrdquo). The Company also provides its executive officers with severance and change-in-control benefits as well as a limited number of perquisites and other personal benefits. Our discussion below, under the caption ldquoElements of Executive Compensationrdquo, explains each of these elements. In evaluating the mix of these compensation components, as well as the short-term and long-term value of the executive compensation plans, the compensation committee considers both the performance and skills of each executive, as well as the compensation paid to those in similar organizations with similar responsibilities, as outlined below.  Objective1: Provide incentives to Company executives to maximize stockholder return.As a part of its long-term equity-based incentives, the compensation committee uses both time-based and performance-based restricted shares in an effort to align the interests of the Companyrsquos executives and stockholders.  The compensation committee believes that granting restricted shares based on performance, which then vest incrementally over time, but only so long as an executive remains employed by the Company, encourages an executive to increase the Companyrsquos stock value so the executive can realize a greater value in connection with those shares once they vest.  -26-  The compensation committee awarded performance shares to Mr. Udell and Mr. Childers in March 2016, pursuant to which restricted shares could have been earned in March 2017 based on the attainment of certain 2016 performance goals. The compensation committee also awarded performance shares to Mr. Udell and Mr. Childers in March 2017, pursuant to which some restricted shares were granted in 2017 upon the closing of the FairPoint acquisition, and pursuant to which other restricted shares could have been earned in March 2018 based on the attainment of certain full-year 2017 performance goals.  The compensation committee also awarded time-based restricted shares to each of Mr. Udell and Mr. Childers in March 2017. The ultimate value of these restricted share awards varies with the performance of the Companyrsquos outstanding common stock and thus fortifies the alignment between the executives and stockholders.  During 2017, Mr. Currey also received a grant of restricted shares equal to, and under the same terms as, the restricted share grants made to other non-employee directors.  In addition to equity-based incentives, the compensation committee also bases a significant portion of an executiversquos annual cash bonus on the attainment of certain corporate performance metrics, which encourages the executive to increase the Companyrsquos profitability, and in turn, its stock value.  Objective2: Enable the Company to attract and retain talented, results-oriented managers capable of leading key areas of the Companyrsquos business. In order to assist the compensation committee in setting compensation levels, the committee has, from time to time, obtained from Willis Towers Watson, its outside consultant, information regarding compensation paid by the Companyrsquos peer group, as defined below. The Company believes this benchmarking work plays an important role in helping the Company ensure its compensation programs are competitive within its industry so that it can both retain and attract talented managers.

      "Pay Ratio DisclosurePursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are required to provide the following information with respect to fiscal 2017:We determined that the annual total compensation of Mr. Demshur, our CEO, was $8,973,20432and that the median of the annual total compensation of from the aggregate sampling of employees of our company (other than Mr. Demshur, our CEO) was $57,546 therefore the ratio of these two amounts is 15632to 1. If the CEO does not actually receive any of the non-equity incentive compensation, his total compensation would be $7,303,19332for 2017 and the ratio of our CEO's compensation to the that of the median employee would be 12732to 1. Please the Summary Compensation table on page 33 for our CEO's compensation.Given the size, composition and global diversity of our workforce, we used statistical sampling to identify the 8220median employee.8221160 Using the measure of total cash compensation consisting of base salary, allowance, bonus and pension paid as provided by our payroll records, we grouped countries based on similarity of median compensation levels and compensation standard variances and determined an appropriate sample size for each group of countries. The aggregate sample size covered more than two-thirds of our employee population.42This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee8217s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.43COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORTIn preparation for the filing of this proxy statement with the SEC, the Compensation Committee:8226reviewed and discussed the Company's disclosure set forth herein below the heading \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" with management and8226based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, recommended to the Supervisory Board that the disclosure set forth herein below the heading \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December16031, 2017.Submitted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Supervisory Directors.COMPENSATION COMMITTEEMichael Straughen (Chairman)Margaret Ann van Kempen44AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORTFor the year ended December16031, 2017, the Audit Committee consisted of Mrs. Carnes and Messrs.160Sodderland and Straughen.

      "PAY RATIO   Pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (8220SEC8221) adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the annual total compensation of the CEO to that of the median employee for fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2017. We believe the pay ratio disclosed herein is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of the SEC8217s Regulation S-K. To identify the median employee and to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO, we took the following steps:  x2022 We selected December 31, 2017, which is within the last three months of fiscal year 2017, as the date in which we would identify our median employee because it enabled us to make such identification in an efficient and reasonable manner   x2022 We identified our median employee, after accumulating annual base pay, bonus earned, and equity granted (8220Annual Compensation8221) for our entire global employee workforce, excluding our  CEO, based on the local currency of the countries in which they were employed for the fiscal year that ended on December 31, 2017  x2022 Each employee8217s Annual Compensation was then converted to U.S. Dollars using average foreign currency rates prevailing during the year, and arrayed high to low to identify our median employee and  x2022 Once the median employee was identified using Annual Compensation, we used the same annual compensation elements required for inclusion in our Summary Compensation Table for our NEOs and calculated the annual total compensation for our median employee to be $82,530 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our CEO8217s annual total compensation for 2017 was $5,056,803, as reported in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table on page 32, and was approximately 61 times the annual total compensation for the median employee.        2018 Proxy Statement160|16043    PROPOSAL 2 8211 ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE the COMPENSATION of our named executive officers   Pursuant to Section16014A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules. This proposal, commonly known as a 8220say-on-pay8221 proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our NEOs on an annual basis. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies, and practices described in this proxy statement.  As described under the heading Compensation Discussion and Analysis on page 20, our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain qualified executives, recognize and reward individual performance, and align executive pay with stockholder return over both the short and long term. Under this program, our NEOs are rewarded for the achievement of specific annual and long-term strategic, financial, and operational goals, and increases in stockholder value. For additional information about our executive compensation program, please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page16020. Accordingly, we are asking our stockholders to vote 8220FOR8221 the following resolution at our Annual Meeting: 8220RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company8217s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.8221 The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee, or our Board.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSUREAs required by SEC rules, we are providing the following information regarding the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees except our CEO, Mr. Munyan, and the annual total compensation of our CEO. We also are providing information as to the methodology that we used to determine the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees except our CEO. 8226The median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than the CEO) was $32,355.30. The median employee8217s position is a warehouse material handler position.8226The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table, was $1,402,119. 8226Based on the foregoing, for fiscal 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than the CEO) was 43.332to 1.To determine the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, we used the following methodology:8226We used our employee population as of January 1, 2018 to determine the median. As of that date, our employee population was 2,170.8226We used calendar 2017 W-2 earnings (and a functional equivalent thereof for foreign employees) to rank our employee population from lowest to highest based on their annual compensation. Before performing the ranking, we made certain adjustments, as described below.8226We excluded from the ranking any employee who was employed for part of calendar 2017 but who was not employed on January 1, 2018.8226We made adjustments to annualize the earnings of employees who commenced employment with us during the course of calendar 2017 and remained employed with us on January 1, 2018.8226For foreign employees, we adjusted the foreign currency in which their earnings were paid to U.S. dollars using a 12-month average of the exchange rates in effect during calendar 2017.8226Although SEC rules generally allow for the exclusion of up to 5% of foreign employees as well as employees hired in connection with acquisitions completed during the most recently completed fiscal year, in determining the median, we did not exclude any foreign employees, nor did we exclude any employees who joined us in connection with acquisitions completed during fiscal 2018.8226Once the median employee was identified based on calendar 2017 annual earnings as described above, we determined the median employee8217s annual total compensation for our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, and we used that amount to determine the pay ratio.POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROLIn this section, we describe payments and benefits that would be provided to our named executive officers upon several events of termination or upon a change of control, assuming that the relevant event occurred on March16031, 2018. The information in this section does not include:8226benefits generally provided to all salaried employees8226provisions under our 2013 Stock Plan and 2004 Stock Plan allowing an option holder to exercise within 90 or 180 days after his or her last day of employment those stock options that were exercisable as of his or her last day of employment, other than in the case of termination for cause or voluntary resignation and8226benefits that would be provided upon death under supplemental life insurance policies paid for by CSS for the benefit of our named executive officers.With respect to supplemental life insurance policies purchased for the benefit of our named executive officers, premiums paid by CSS for such policies are included in the amounts shown in the 8220All other compensation8221 column of the Summary Compensation Table.41Severance AgreementsUnder our employment agreement with Mr. Munyan, we will provide severance payments and medical benefits to him if we terminate his employment (other than for cause): (a) on or before the then-current expiration date of the employment agreement, or (b) following the expiration thereof, but only if the agreement expires due to the sending by us of a non-renewal notice to Mr. Munyan. Under our employment agreement with Mr. Edwards, we will provide severance payments to him if we terminate his employment other than for cause prior to March 31, 2020. Under the offer letter with Mr. White, we will provide severance payments to him if we terminate his employment other than for cause. Severance payments under the foregoing employment agreements would consist of a continuation of salary payments, at the executive8217s then-current annual base salary for a period of two years for Mr.160Munyan and one year for Messrs. Edwards, and White, respectively. Such payments would be made in equal installments in accordance with our normal payroll cycle for active employees, and commencement of such payments will be delayed as necessary to avoid adverse consequences under Section160409A of the Code.\n"

Mr.Linebarger's compensation (as reported in the Summary Compensation Table) for 2017 was 275 times the similarly calculated compensation of our median employee. The compensation amounts used to calculate the ratio are as follows: 2017 Annual Total Compensation 8203  8203 8203 8203 N.T. Linebarger 8203 $16,387,661 8203 8203 8203 Median Employee 8203 $59,682 8203 8203 8203 To identify our median employee, we began by reviewing the 2017 annual base salary and hourly wages plus target variable compensation (target total cash compensation) of all Cummins employees globally, including all full-time and part-time employees who were on Cummins' payroll as of December31, 2017. We did not annualize the base salaries or hourly wages of permanent employees who had been employed by Cummins for less than the full year. We converted the annual target total cash compensation of all employees to United States dollars to aid in the identification of the median employee. 8203 Cummins Inc. 1242018PROXY STATEMENT57 8203 Table of Contents ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (ITEM 13 ON THE PROXY CARD) Executive compensation is important to us and to our shareholders. Since 2011, we have held annual advisory shareholder votes to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as required by Section14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. At this year's Annual Meeting, we once again are seeking input from our shareholders through an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section and the accompanying compensation tables and narratives contained in this proxy statement. In 2017, consistent with the recommendation of our Board, our shareholders voted in favor of our executive compensation, with 94.3% of votes cast in favor. Principles of Our Executive Compensation Program We believe the level of compensation received by executives should be closely tied to our corporate financial and stock price performance. This principle is apparent in the design of our executive compensation program and in the specific compensation packages we award. In addition to ensuring pay for performance, we follow several other principles when designing and implementing our executive compensation program. MARKET POSITIONING We believe that, on average, our executives' target total direct compensation opportunity (consisting of base salary, target annual bonus, and target long-term incentive value) should be at the median of the market. SHORT-TERM/LONG-TERM BALANCE We believe that there should be a balance between annual and long-term elements of compensation. PAY AT RISK We believe that the more senior an executive's position, the more of their compensation should be \"at risk,\" which means it will vary based on Cummins' financial and stock price performance. ALIGNMENT WITH SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS We believe that equity-based compensation and stock ownership should be a substantial part of our executive compensation program in order to link executives' compensation with our shareholders' returns. The greater the level of responsibility of the officer, the more their compensation should be stock-based and the higher their stock ownership requirement should be. RETENTION We believe that our compensation program should support retention of our experienced executives and achievement of our leadership succession plans. SIMPLE AND TRANSPARENT We believe that our executive compensation program should be transparent to our investors and employees as well as simple and easy to understand. 8203 58Cummins Inc. 1242018PROXY STATEMENT Table of Contents Compensation Elements Support Pay-for-Performance Policy We provide a majority of compensation through arrangements designed to hold our executive officers accountable for Cummins' business results and to reward them for consistently strong corporate per\n",

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure  Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. James A. Reinstein: For 2017, our Chief Executive Officer had total compensation of $6,264,728, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table at page 42 of this proxy statement. We determined that our median employeersquos annual total compensation was $99,901 for 2017. As a result, our Chief Executive Officerrsquos annual total compensation for 2017 was approximately 63 times the annual total compensation of our median employee. Our median employee was determined using all employees as of December 31, 2017, exclusive of our Chief Executive Officer. Wages and salaries were annualized for those employees that were not employed for the full year of 2017. Base salary and cash bonus or sales commission, as appropriate, were considered when determining the median employee. We elected not to include grant date fair value of equity awards in determining the median employee because we determined that equity was not granted widely enough throughout the organization, and could serve to artificially skew the analysis. All 2017 compensation not paid in US dollars was converted to US dollars using the historic exchange rate made available by the Federal Reserve System of the U.S. as of December 31, 2017. All equity for our Chief Executive Officer was recorded at grant date fair value.  We have elected to also disclose a supplemental ratio that excludes the grant date fair value of the non-standard equity award granted to our Chief Executive Officer in December 2017. Our Chief Executive Officerrsquos annual total compensation for 2017 includes a non-recurring award of 100,000 restricted stock units that vest as follows: 15%, 15%, 25%, and 45% of the shares vest on the first, second, third and fourth anniversary of the vesting commencement date (December 15, 2017), respectively. The award has a grant date fair value of $4,740,000. We do not generally make awards of this nature to our Chief Executive Officer annually, and none of the restricted stock or stock options granted to our Chief Executive Officer in 2017 has vested as of the date of this proxy statement.

This award was made after consultation with the Compensation Committeersquos compensation consultant, Compensia, and was intended to address certain anomalies related to our Chief Executive Officerrsquos total compensation following recommended revisions to our Peer Group in October 2017. If the grant date fair value of the 2017 equity award were excluded, our Chief Executive Officerrsquos annual total compensation for 2017 would have been approximately 15 times our median employeersquos annual total compensation for 2017.  -48- Table of Contents  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT  The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of SEC Regulation S-K with management.

      "Pay Ratio For 2017, the annual total compensation of Mr.Grant, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Investment Officer and President, of $4,406,486, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table (the 147CEO Compensation148), was approximately 9.8 times the annual total compensation of a median employee calculated in the same manner of $452,179. We identified the median employee using the annual base salary and bonus, as of December31, 2017, plus any long-term incentive stock awards granted in 2017 for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December31, 2017, the last day of our payroll year. After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our CEO Compensation. To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and the CEO Compensation, we took the following steps:   149  We determined that, as of December31, 2017, our employee population consisted of 16 individuals with all of these individuals located in the United States and all of whom are full-time.   149  We used a consistently applied compensation measure to identify our median employee of comparing the annual base salary, cash payments and the grant date fair value of stock awards made pursuant to the qualitative component of the 2017 Bonus Plan, cash payments made pursuant to the quantitative component of the 2017 Bonus Plan relating to performance in 2017, any long-term incentive stock awards granted in 2017, and contributions made on the employee146s behalf to his or her SEP in 2017.   149  We identified our median employee by consistently applying this compensation measure to all of our employees, excluding our CEO. Since all of our employees, including our CEO, are located in the United States, we did not make any cost of living adjustments in identifying the median employee.   149  After we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee146s compensation for the 2017 year in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $452,179. The elements of such annual total compensation include salary, bonus, long-term incentive stock awards and contributions that we made on the employee146s behalf to his or her SEP for 2017.   149  With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the 147Total148 column of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference under Item 11 of Part III of our Annual Report.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure Rule Pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the 147Dodd-Frank Act148), the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee146s annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of the principal executive officer (147PEO148). The PEO of our Company is Mr. Hawkins. We believe that our compensation philosophy must be consistent and internally equitable to motivate our employees to create shareholder value. The purpose of the new required disclosure is to provide a measure of the equitability of pay within the organization. We are committed to internal pay equity, and our compensation committee monitors the relationship between the pay our PEO receives and the pay our non-executive employees receive. For 2017, the annual total compensation of Mr.Hawkins, our PEO, of $3,922,554, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table below, was approximately 34 times the annual total compensation of $114,791 of a median employee calculated in the same manner. We identified the median employee using the annual base salary and target annual cash incentive compensation, as of December31, 2017, plus any long-term equity incentive awards granted in 2017 for all individuals, who were employed by us on December31, 2017, the last day of our payroll year (whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis). Compensation Risks We reviewed our compensation policies and practices for employees to determine whether they encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. Due to the greater emphasis placed on incentive compensation at higher  38 Table of Contents levels of our organization, and the fact that these individuals are more likely to make decisions that impact corporate performance and could have a material adverse effect on us, the review focused primarily on our executive compensation policies and practices. Based on this review, we concluded that risks arising from our policies and practices for compensating employees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. Our conclusion was based primarily on the following findings:   149  vesting schedules for LTIP units and restricted stock cause management to have a significant amount of unvested awards at any given time   149  our executive compensation program has a significant focus on long-term equity compensation   149  the goals for our equity incentive program are aligned with long-term performance objectives/metrics, reflect a balanced mix of individual and company goals aligned with our strategic objectives, are both quantitative and qualitative and provide a comprehensive framework for assessing performance   149  incentive compensation opportunities are capped and therefore do not incentivize employees to maximize short-term performance at the expense of long-term performance   149  our compensation levels and opportunities are in keeping with appropriate competitive practice and   149  our executives and directors are expected to maintain an ownership interest in our Company, which aligns their interests with those of shareholders. Director Compensation Directors who are employees of our Company or our subsidiaries do not receive compensation for their service as directors. We provide the following compensation fornon-employeedirectors:   149  an annual retainer of $55,000 for services as a director   149  an additional annual retainer of $20,000 for directors who serve as the chair of our audit committee (and $8,750 for directors, other than the chair, who serve as members of our audit committee)   149  an additional annual retainer of $15,000 for directors who serve as the chair of our compensation committee (and $6,250 for directors, other than the chair, who serve as members of our compensation committee)   149  an additional annual retainer of $12,500 for directors who serve as the chair of our investment and/or nominating and corporate governance committee (and $5,000 for directors, other than the chair, who serve as members of our investment and/or nominating and corporate governance committee)   149  an additional annual retainer of $30,000 for the Chairman of the Board   149  a phantom share award, subject to vesting over one year, having a value of $80,000on the date of each annual meeting of stockholders at which anon-employeedirector isre-electedto our board of directors and   149  an additional phantom share award, subject to vesting over one year, having a value of $30,000on the dat\n",

All 16,406 employees in our population on December31, 2017, were considered in our identification of the median employee, including those employed on a full-time, part-time, or temporary basis. No cost of living adjustments were made to determine the median employee. After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our CEO Compensation.

      "Pay Ratio As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer Mr.Kevin Sayer (our 147CEO148). For 2017, (i) the median of the annual total compensation of our employees was $94,472.64 (ii) the annual total compensation of our CEO was $7,924,868.32 and (iii)the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of our employees was 86 to  49 Table of Contents 1. We believe this ratio, which was calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of RegulationS-K, to be a reasonable estimate, based upon the assumptions and adjustments described below. Calculation Methodology We identified the employee with compensation at the median of the compensation of all of our employees (the 147median employee148) by considering our employee population as of December 1, 2017 (the 147employee population determination date148). We considered all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on a world-wide basis (including our consolidated subsidiaries) on the employee population determination date, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, seasonal or temporary basis, as applicable. We did not include any contractors or other non-employee workers in our employee population. To identify our median employee, we chose to use a consistently-applied compensation measure, which we selected as base salary for 2017. For employees paid other than in U.S. dollars, we converted their compensation to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rates in effect on December1, 2017. For permanent employees hired during 2017, we annualized their base salary or wages as if they had been employed for the entire measurement period. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustment. Using this methodology, we identified the individual at the median of our employee population, who was a Business Systems Analyst based in the United States. We then calculated the annual total compensation for this individual using the same methodology we use to calculate the amount reported for our CEO in the 147Total148 column of the 2017 Summary Compensation Table as set forth in this proxy statement. As disclosed in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table, the annual total compensation for our CEO was $7,924,868. Because SEC rules for identifying the median of the annual total compensation of all employees allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, apply certain exclusions, and make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee population and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to our pay ratio, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may have used different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios. As explained by the SEC when it adopted these rules, the rule was not designed to facilitate comparisons of pay ratios among different companies, even companies within the same industry, but rather to allow stockholders to better understand and assess each particular company146s compensation practices and pay ratio disclosures.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE In August 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of a company's median employee's (\"Median Employee\") annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of a company's chief executive officer (\"CEO\"). The Company's CEO during the 2017 fiscal year was Mr.Phil Hagerman, and his total compensation was $1,679,674, (the \"CEO Compensation\"), which amounts, for this purpose include the payments Mr.Hagerman diverted to the social responsibility budget in 2017 in addition to the totals shown in the Summary Compensation Table for 2017. For 2017, the CEO Compensation was approximately 40.3 times the total compensation of the Median Employee, whose compensation for 2017 was $41,648, as illustrated in the table below. The Median Employee is a full-time hourly employee at our corporate 43 Table of Contents headquarters, and the total compensation of such Median Employee included a small bonus in accordance with Company Policy and the value of a 401k match. The Company's CEO to Median Employee pay ratio was calculated in accordance with SEC requirements however, due to the flexibility afforded by Item402(u) of RegulationS-K in calculating the pay ratio, the pay ratio presented herein is a reasonable estimate and may not be comparable to the pay ratio presented by other companies. We monitor the relationship between the compensation of our executive officers and the compensation of our non-managerial employees and we believe our compensation philosophy and process yield an equitable result. In determining the Median Employee, a listing was prepared of all employees as of December18, 2017, , excluding the CEO of the Company and including the following wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company: Affinity Biotech,Inc. American Homecare Federation BioRx,LLC Comfort Infusion,Inc. MedPro Rx,Inc. Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy of Philadelphia Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy of Boothwyn At-Home XAS Diplomat Specialty Pharmacy of Los Angeles County, Inc. Accurate Rx Pharmacy Consulting,LLC WRB Communications,LLC Focus Rx Pharmacy Services,Inc. and Focus Rx,Inc. In December 2017, the Company acquired LDI Holding Company,LLC, and in November, 2017, Pharmaceutical Technologies,Inc., whose aggregate 330 employees were excluded from this calculation. Wages and salaries were annualized for those included permanent employees that were on leave or not employed for the full year of 2017. The value of the Company's 401(k) plan contributions, commissions, bonuses and other perquisites were included in the calculation of total compensation for all active employees. In identifying the Median Employee, the compensation components (wages/salary, bonus, 401K contributions, commissions, and other perquisites) of each employee (excluding the CEO) were totaled and the employees' compensation was ranked from highest to lowest. The employee with the median total compensation was selected and identified as the Median Employee. After identifying the Median Employee, annual total compensation was calculated for the Median Employee using the same methodology we use for CEO Compensation.

This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. We determined that the 2017 annual total compensation of the median compensated employee (who is a part-time store associate) of our temporary, part-time, and full-time employee base who were employed as of February2, 2018, other than our CEO, was $13,387 our CEO's 2017 annual total compensation was $8,806,409 and the ratio of these amounts is 1:658.

Pursuant to SEC rules, we excluded all 69non-U.S. employees from the following countries: Hong Kong(17) China(50) Mexico(1) and Turkey(1). After applying this exemption, the employee population used for purposes of identifying the median employee consisted of 123,158 temporary, part-time, and full-time employees located solely in the United States. To identify the median compensated employee, we used W-2 Box5 Medicare wages for the period from February4, 2017 through February2, 2018, with such amounts annualized for those permanent employees who did not work for the full year. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 8203 48Dollar General 1242018 Proxy StatementmiddotExecutive Compensation 8203 Table of Contents SECURITY OWNERSHIP For purposes of the tables below, a person is a \"beneficial owner\" of a security over which that person has or shares voting or investment power or which that person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60days.

      "Pay Ratio  We believe our executive compensation program must be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our employees to create stockholder value. We monitor the relationship between the compensation of our executive officers and the compensation of our non-managerial employees. For 2017, the total compensation of Ofer Elyakim, our Chief Executive Officer, of $1,369,673, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table above, was approximately 12.7times the total cash compensation of a median employee calculated in the same manner of $107,761.  Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with the SECrsquos rules pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 31, 2017, the last day of our payroll year. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees. In our calculation, we annualized the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2017.  43   Employment Agreements  Each of our named executive officers has a written employment agreement with us.  In connection with Ofer Elyakimrsquos appointment as our Chief Executive Officer in July2009, he entered into an employment agreement with DSP Israel, effective July 1, 2009. Mr. Elyakimrsquos employment agreement was amended in January 31, 2011, May 16, 2011, November 5, 2012, March 5, 2013 and October 31, 2013. Mr.Elyakimrsquos 2016 annual salary was $300,000, subject to adjustment from time to time. In 2017, Mr. Elyakimrsquos base salary was increased by 10% to $330,000. In addition to any other bonus program approved by the board, Mr.Elyakim is eligible for a bonus under the terms of an annual performance-based bonus plan approved by the compensation committee of our board of directors. Pursuant to Mr.Elyakimrsquos employment agreement, as amended, if Mr. Elyakim desires to terminate his employment with the company (which for purposes of Mr. Elyakimrsquos employment agreement includes any subsidiary of the company) without good reason (as defined in his employment agreement), he will have to notify the company eighteen months in advance. Similarly, if the company desires to terminate Mr. Elyakimrsquos employment with the company without cause, it will have to notify Mr. Elyakim eighteen months in advance. However, if the company wishes to terminate Mr. Elyakimrsquos employment but fails to provide him with the eighteen-month advance written notice, Mr. Elyakim would be entitled to receive an amount equal to eighteen months of his then-effective salary. If the requisite advance notice of eighteen months is provided by Mr. Elyakim to the company if he desires to terminate his employment with the company without good reason, then: (i)all of his rights under his employment agreement would continue during the eighteen-month period, and (ii)all equity awards held by him prior to the termination of his employment with the company would accelerate and immediately vest eighteen months following the date of such requisite notice and be exercisable in whole or in part at any time from the date of the vesting of the respective equity awards for a period of two years. In addition, if Mr. Elyakimrsquos employment with the company is terminated by (i)the company following a change in control (as defined in his employment agreement) (ii)Mr. Elyakim for good reason or (iii)the company without cause (as defined in his employment agreement), all of Mr. Elyakimrsquos rights under his employment agreement would continue for eighteen months and all equity awards held by Mr. Elyakim would accelerate and immediately vest and be exercisable in whole or in part at any time for two years following the termination of his employment. Furthermore, if Mr. Elyakimrsquos employment is terminated by the company without cause, by Mr. Elyakim for good reason, or by Mr. Elyakim without good reason after providing the requisite notice of eighteen months in advance, Mr. Elyakim shall be paid a pro-rata portion of any performance-based bonus for the year in which his full-time employment is terminated.  44   In June2002, in connection with Dror Levyrsquos initial employment as our Controller, he entered into an employment agreement with DSP Israel.

      "PAY RATIO As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item402(u) of RegulationS-K, we are providing the following estimate of the ratio between the median annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr.Carrigan, our CEO throughout 2017. We selected November15, 2017, which is within the last three months of 2017, as the date upon which we would identify the median employee. We chose \"base pay\" as the measure to determine our median employee. We then calculated an annual base pay based on a reasonable estimate of hours worked during 2017 for hourly workers, and upon salary levels for the remaining employees. We annualized pay for those who commenced work during 2017. We identified the median base pay and selected an employee with the median pay. With respect to the annual total compensation of the \"median employee,\" we identified and calculated the elements of such employee's compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item402(c)(2)(x) of RegulationS-K, consistent with how we calculate executive compensation in the Summary Compensation Table, resulting in annual total compensation of $82,645.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the Company determined that the total annual compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer in respect of 2017 was approximately 62 times the median of the total annual compensation of all of our employees (other than our Chief Executive Officer) in respect of 2017. For purposes of the pay ratio calculation, we identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total compensation for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on October1, 2017. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis, excluding contingent and outsourced employees, consultants and interns. To calculate the annual total compensation for all employees we included all compensation earned by the employees for 2017, including salary, bonus, equity compensation and Company 401(k) contribution. The median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our Chief Executive Officer) was $93,681. The total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer is set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table on page 34 of this Proxy Statement under the heading 147Total Compensation.148 TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS Policies and Procedures for Approval of Related Party Transactions The Board has formally adopted a policy with respect to related party transactions that provides the framework under which such transactions are reviewed, approved or ratified.

      "Pay RatioPursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Company is required to disclose the ratio of its median employee's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of its principal executive officer. The Company's principal executive officer is Douglas R. Waggoner, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.In determining the median employee, a listing was prepared of all employees, excluding Mr. Waggoner, as of December16031, 2017. Since all Echo employees reside in the United States, no employees were excluded from the list and the Company did not make any other adjustments. Total compensation earned from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 was gathered for each employee, which includes salary, stock awards, earned non-equity incentive compensation, and other compensation. From these results, we identified the median employee and calculated the median employee's total annual compensation for 201732in accordance with the SEC rules for reporting compensation in the Summary Compensation Table of the proxy. Under this calculation, our median employee's total annual compensation for 201732was $47,162.For the total annual compensation of Mr. Waggoner, we used the amount reported in the \"total\" column of our Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. Mr. Waggoner earned 201732total compensation of $4,289,727, which is the total of his salary, stock awards, non-equity incentive compensation, and other compensation. As a result we estimate that Mr. Waggoner's 201732annual total compensation was approximately 9132times that of our median employee, which was calculated in a manner consistent with the applicable SEC disclosure rules.This information is being provided solely for compliance purposes. Because the Compensation Committee has determined the ratio is not an adequate indicator of linking pay with performance, the Compensation Committee does not materially consider this ratio when evaluating compensation arrangements. Moreover, given the different methodologies that various public companies use to determine an estimate of their CEO pay ratio, we do not believe that the estimated ratio reported should be used as a basis for comparison between any companies.COMPENSATION AND RISKWe have reviewed our employee compensation policies and practices and have determined that these policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. We utilize Aon Hewitt, an independent third party, to advise the Compensation Committee on matters related to compensation and find that the design of our compensation programs and the level of oversight is sufficient to mitigate potential risks associated with our current policies and practices.Our compensation program is designed to provide a mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation and to reward a mix of different performance measures. The variable (cash incentive and performance share) portions of compensation are designed to reward both annual performance (under the short-term incentive plan) and longer-term performance (under the performance share program). We believe this design mitigates any incentive for short-term risk-taking that could be detrimental to our long-term interests.Our senior executives are subject to stock ownership requirements, which we believe incentivize our executives to consider our long-term interests and to discourage excessive risk-taking that could negatively impact our stock price.Our incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep payout \"cliffs\" that might encourage short-term business decisions in order to meet a payout threshold.3230201732DIRECTOR COMPENSATIONDirectors who are full-time employees of the Company receive no additional fees for service as a director. In 2017, each non-employee director received a combination of cash payments and equity-based compensation as shown in the tables and narrative below. Under our 2008 Stock Incentive Plan, directors are eligible to receive stock options and other equity grants at the discretion of the Compensation Committee or other administrators of the plan. If a Change in Control (as defined under the 2008 Stock Incentive Plan) occurs, or if the director8217s service is terminated due to death, disability, or by the Company (or its Board or stockholders) other than for cause, all unvested shares of restricted stock will immediately vest. In January1602017, each non-employee director received a restricted stock grant of approximately $100,000 that vests on the first anniversary of the grant date.201732DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLEThe following table summarizes the total compensation that our non-employee directors earned in 201732for services as members of our Board:Name160Fees Earned or Paid in Cash ($)160Sto\n",

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the annual total compensation for our CEO was $14,383,229, as reported in the final column of the Summary Compensation Table at page 46, and the annual total compensation for our global median employee was $60,556, calculated in accordance with the rules applicable to the Summary Compensation Table. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the annual total compensation for our CEO was 238 times the annual total compensation for our global median employee. For purposes of identifying our global median employee, we used our global employee population as of November 1, 2017, which consisted of 52,563 total global employees, of whom 21,908 were employed in the United States and 30,655 were employed in foreign jurisdictions. As permitted by SEC rules and regulations, we excluded: (i) leased employees and independent contractors (ii) approximately 827 employees from the Laboratories Anios, Prochimservice, and Georgia-Pacific Paper Chemicals Business acquisitions that closed in 2017 and (iii) 2,546 employees in the foreign jurisdictions of Uganda (92 employees), South Africa (506 employees), Chile (564 employees), Russia (595 employees), and Indonesia (789 employees). After giving effect to these exclusions, the number of global employees from which our global median employee was identified was 50,017. We used the sum of base salary and commissions for the 12-month period ending October 31, 2017 as the compensation measure that we applied consistently to all global employees, and we annualized this amount for global employees who commenced employment during that period. For global employees paid in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we converted to U.S. dollars using treasury rates as of September 30, 2017. We applied statistical sampling with the assistance of an outside expert to identify the population of global employees with compensation within a 1 percent range around the median. Once this population of global employees was identified, we included all other elements of annual total compensation to determine the global median employee, including, but not limited to, bonus and overtime pay, the grant date fair value of stock and option awards, the actuarial increase in the present value of pension benefits, Company contributions to defined contribution plans, and perquisites.

This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions summarized below. In this summary, we refer to the employee who received such Median Annual Compensation, who was selected in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, as the ldquoMedian Employee.rdquo For purposes of this disclosure, the date used to identify the Median Employee was December 31, 2017 (the ldquoDetermination Daterdquo).  40 Table of Contents  To identify the Median Employee, we first determined our employee population as of the Determination Date for purposes of the calculation. We then measured the compensation of 136 employees, which represented all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees of us and our subsidiaries as of the Determination Date. The median employee was determined using 2017 W-2 wages for all U.S. employees and equivalent taxable compensation for all non-U.S. employees.  CEO Compensation for purposes of this disclosure represents the total compensation reported for Mr. Gay for under ldquoSummary Compensation Tablerdquo for the 2017 fiscal year. For purposes of this disclosure, Median Annual Compensation was $92,446, and was calculated by totaling for our Median Employee all applicable elements of compensation for the 2017 fiscal year in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.   REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  This report is not deemed to be soliciting material filed with the SEC or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed with the SEC.  The Audit Committee oversees the Companyrsquos financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The Companyrsquos management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the consolidated audited financial statements and the related schedules in the Annual Report with Company management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.  The Audit Committee is governed by a charter. A copy of the charter is available on the Companyrsquos website at www.energyrecovery.com. The charter was last amended effective December 4, 2009. The Audit Committee held five meetings during fiscal year 2017. The Audit Committee is comprised solely of independent directors as defined by the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act.  The meetings of the Audit Committee are designed to facilitate and encourage communication among the committee, the Company, the Companyrsquos internal audit function and the Companyrsquos independent auditor. The Audit Committee discussed with the Companyrsquos internal auditors and independent auditor the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets with the internal auditors and the independent auditor, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations their evaluations of the Companyrsquos internal control, including internal control over financial reporting and the overall quality of the Companyrsquos financial reporting.  The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with BDO USA LLP, which was responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those consolidated audited financial statements and related schedules with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, its judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Companyrsquos accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (ldquoPCAOBrdquo), including PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications With Audit Committees, the rules of the SEC, and other applicable regulations.

With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported for 2017 in the \"Total\" column of the Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement. The annual total compensation of the median employee was calculated on substantially the same basis. To identify the median employee, we used annual base salary for all employees as of 20 December 2017, including employees who joined the Company as a result of our acquisition of Atwood in October 2017, using the approach described below:8226We determined that, as of 20 December 2017, our employee population consisted of approximately 4,600 individuals working at Ensco plc and its consolidated subsidiaries. We selected 20 December 2017, which is within the last three months of 2017, as the date upon which we would identify the median employee to allow sufficient time to identify the median employee given the global scope of our operations. 8226Our median employee was based on our worldwide employee population, without regard to their location, compensation arrangements, or whether such employees are full-time, part-time, seasonal or temporary workers. 8226Annual base salary is defined as the fixed portion of each employee's compensation arrangements that is paid without regard to our financial or operational performance in a given year. We gathered the requisite information applying this compensation measure with respect to our employees using the 12-month period ending 31 December 2017. 8226We annualised the compensation of all permanent employees who were hired in 2017 but did not work for us or our consolidated subsidiaries for the entire fiscal year, but did not annualise the compensation of any part-time or seasonal employee.8226We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the median employee.8226Using this methodology, we determined the median employee annual base salary for the 12-month period ending 31 December 2017 was $85,537.Given the global distribution of our employee population, we use a variety of pay elements to structure the compensation arrangements of our employees. We believe that annual base salary is an appropriate, consistently applied compensation measure that provides a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilise different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.68Director CompensationCompensation of Non-Executive DirectorsThe Compensation Committee uses a combination of retainer fees and equity compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on the Board. Our Compensation Committee periodically reviews non-executive director compensation, which includes review of data received from Pearl Meyer and, from time to time, recommends changes to the Board. Following the review of this information in 2017, our Board did not make any changes to non-executive director compensation. Total non-executive director compensation generally is intended to approximate the median of our compensation peer group companies.Annual Retainer FeesCompensation of our non-executive directors currently is composed of an annual retainer of $100,000. Additional annual retainers are paid as follows: Chairman of the Board $100,000 Audit Committee Chair $20,000 Compensation Committee Chair $15,000 and Nominating and Governance Committee Chair $10,000 (reduced in 2016 from $15,000). All retainer fees are paid quarterly in advance and are prorated for a partial quarter of service as a director, Chairman of the Board or Committee Chair. Equity CompensationAdditionally, our LTIP provides that non-executive directors receive an automatic annual grant of equity compensation following each annual general meeting of shareholders. In accordance with the compensation policy, restricted share units equivalent to an aggregate value of $200,000 (reduced in 2016 from $250,000) were granted to our non-executive directors, except our independent Chairman of the Board, effective 1160June 2017. Our independent Chairman of the Board received a restricted share unit award of $275,000 (reduced in 2016 from $325,000), effective 1 June 2017. Restricte\n"

      "PAY RATIOAs permitted under SEC rules, to determine our median employee, we calculated the annual base pay based on a reasonable estimate of hours worked during 2017 for hourly workers, and upon salary levels for the remaining employees. We annualized pay for those who commenced work during 2017. We used a statistical sampling methodology to identify the median base pay. Then we identified employees we expected were paid within a 5% range of employees who were paid at that value. As required by the SEC, an employee was selected from that group and we determined that person's total compensation was $60,000. The ratio of CEO pay to median worker pay was 16:1 for 2017.EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION32The following table provides information regarding the securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans as of December16031, 2017.160Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rightsWeighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rightsNumber of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding shares reflected in column (a))Plan Category(a)(b)(c)Equity compensation plans approved by the Company's shareholders106,130$13.37105,245Equity compensation plans not approved by the Company's shareholders821282128212Total106,130 (1)$13.37105,245 (2)(1) Includes the following:8226106,13032shares of common stock used as the base for grants of stock settled stock appreciation rights under the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan(2) Includes the following:822686,08232shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan822619,16332shares of common stock available for issuance under the Non-management Director Stock Plan.28COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION160The members of the Company8217s Compensation Committee are set forth on page 9.

For information about related person transactions involving members of our Compensation Committee, see Related Person Transactions - Loans to Related Persons.160During 2017, no executive officer of the Company served as (i) a member of a compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Compensation Committee of the Company, (ii) a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Compensation Committee, or (iii) a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director of the Company.RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTINGFIRM - (Proposal A)The Audit Committee has selected Deloitte amp Touche LLP to be the independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2018. The Board, on behalf of the Audit Committee, recommends that the stockholders ratify the appointment of the accounting firm. Although stockholder approval is not required by law and is not binding on the Audit Committee, the appointment is submitted by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors in order to give the stockholders a voice in the designation of auditors. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of Deloitte amp Touche LLP, the engagement of Deloitte amp Touche LLP, will not be affected for fiscal year 2018. However, the Audit Committee will review the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next fiscal year. Even if the resolution is approved, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of different independent auditors at any time during the year if it determines that a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.160THE BOARD, ON BEHALF OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR32THE RATIFICATION OF DELOITTE amp TOUCHE LLP AS THE COMPANY8217S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLICACCOUNTING FIRM.ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION - (Proposal B)We are providing our stockholders the opportunity to vote on an advisory (nonbinding) resolution to approve our executive compensation as described in the section captioned 8220Compensation Discussion and Analysis,8221 the tabular disclosure regarding compensation of our NEOs and the narrative disclosure accompanying those tables, all as set forth in pages 1132through 2932of this Proxy Statement.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure Pursuant to Item402(u) of RegulationS-K and Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, presented below is the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding our Chief Executive Officer). The ratio presented below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item402(u). The 2017 annual total compensation as determined under Item402 of RegulationS-K (\"Item402 Compensation\") for our Chief Executive Officer was $5,706,122. The 2017 Item402 Compensation for our median employee was $256,235. The ratio of our Chief Executive Officer's Item402 Compensation to our median employee's Item402 Compensation for fiscal year 2017 is 22to1. In identifying our median employee, we calculated the annual total cash compensation paid to each of our employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer) for the year ended December31, 2017. Total cash compensation for these purposes included base salary and bonus, and was calculated using internal payroll records. We selected the median employee based on the 54 employees who were employed by us as of November1, 2017. Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies. 63 Table of Contents TRUSTEE COMPENSATION Overview of Trustee Compensation Program The terms of the compensation program for trustees of the Company, excluding Messrs.Zell and Helfand (collectively, the \"Independent Trustees\"), are as follows:            8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203   ANNUAL RETAINER           8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203   Cash       $60,000   8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203   Equity (restricted shares or Time-Based LTIP Units)       $100,000   8203  8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203   Total:       $160,000   8203  8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203  8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203  8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203   ADDITIONAL ANNUAL COMPENSATION           8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203   Lead Independent Trustee       $30,000   8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 \n",

      "Pay Ratio  As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Rumbolz, our Chief Executive Officer and President. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.  For 2017, our last completed fiscal year:   x2022 the median of the annual total compensation (inclusive of base salary, bonus and other items, as described below) of all our employees, other than Mr. Rumbolz, was $69,108 and  x2022 the annual total compensation of Mr. Rumbolz, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, was $2,206,795.  x2022 Based on this information, for 2017, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Rumbolz, our Chief Executive Officer and President, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 31.9160to1601.  To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the 8220median employee,8221 we took the following steps:  1. We determined that, as of December 31, 2017, we had 1,100 employees, with approximately 97% and 3% of the individuals located domestically in the United States (the 8220U.S.8221) and internationally in various foreign jurisdictions, respectively.   2. The relevant payroll and other compensation data for our employee population are maintained in a single system located at our principal headquarters in the U.S. and were utilized to identify the 8220median employee8221 from our employee population. To identify the 8220median employee8221 from our employee population, we compared the amount of base salary of our employees as reflected in our payroll records and included as part of the total compensation reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for 2017. We identified our median employee using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation.   3. Once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee8217s compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in the annual total compensation presented in the pay ratio calculation. The difference between such employee8217s base salary and the employee8217s annual total compensation represents company matching contributions on behalf of the employee to our 401(k) employee savings plan and cost of short-term and long-term disability coverage. Since we do not maintain a defined benefit or other actuarial plan for our employees, and do not otherwise provide a plan for payments or other benefits at, following, or in connection with retirement, the 8220median employee8217s8221 annual total compensation did not include amounts attributable to those types of arrangements. 43   Name and principal position  Year  Salary  Bonus(1)  Stock awards(2)  Option awards(3)  Non-equity incentive plan compensation(4)  All other compensation(5)  Total Michael D.

      "Pay Ratio CalculationAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reformed Consumer Protection Act and Regulation S-K (Item 402(u)), the Company calculated the total 2017 compensation of Tony C. McKim, President and Chief Executive Officer, and compared that compensation to that of the Company's 8216median employee8217.160 These calculations and the corresponding comparison were based on total compensation for all employees (other than Mr. McKim) as of December 31, 2017 by aggregating annual wages (including paid time off), the annual bonus paid under the Company8217s Stakeholder bonus plan, any other bonuses paid for sales referrals, attendance, etc., and the 401(k) match paid by the Company. The end result was compared with the total compensation of Mr. McKim found on page 26. The Company believes that the ratio of pay included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. The First Bancorp 2018 Proxy Statement 8226 Page 30Based on this comparison, the total 2017 compensation of the President/CEO of the Company is 14.7 times that of the total 2017 compensation of the median employee which was $45,237. Because a limited number of our employees receive equity compensation, we did not consider this element in calculating the compensation of our employees other than Mr. McKim for purposes of this pay ratio.Say on PayAt the 2017 Annual Meeting, Shareholders were asked to approve (on a non-binding basis) the compensation of the Company8217s executives.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure In accordance with SEC guidelines, the Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of our CEO146s annual total compensation in fiscal year 2017 to that of the median employee for the same period. We identified the median employee using our total employee population on October1, 2017 and their annual salary and target incentive compensation for each employee. We then calculated the annual total compensation of the median employee in the same manner as the 147Total Compensation148 shown for our CEO in the 147Summary Compensation Table.148 Pay elements that were included in the annual total compensation for the median employee are:   149  Salary received in fiscal year 2017  149  Annual incentive payment received for performance in fiscal year 2017  149  Grant date fair value of stock option and RSU awards granted in fiscal year 2017  149  Own It Honor Awards in merchandise or cash that an employee receives for exemplary work based on recommendations from fellow employee  56 Table of Contents The annual total compensation for fiscal year 2017 for our CEO was $102,210,395 and for the median employee was $50,406. The resulting ratio of our CEO146s pay to the pay of our median employee for fiscal year 2017 is 1 to 2028. The Pay Ratio in 2017 was unusually high due to the long-term equity retention award provided to our CEO in July of 2017. As this long-term grant was not what we consider to be part of the standard annual compensation that is paid to the CEO, we believe it is helpful to also consider the ratio excluding that grant and based on compensation we paid to the CEO for 2017 performance as explained in the 2017 Regular Compensation Overview table on page 42. Using that method the ratio is 1 to 257. Below, we have shown both the actual 2017 CEO Pay Ratio as well as the CEO Pay ratio with compensation for 2017 performance excluding the long-term equity retention award.  2017 CEO to Median Employee Pay Ratio  Adjusted CEO 2017 performance compensation to Median Employee Pay Ratio (CEO comp=2017 base+incentive compensation for 2017 performance+all other compensation for 2017 and excluding retention grant)  1:2028    1:257  Equity Compensation Plan Information The following table sets forth information regarding equity compensation plans of First Data as of December31, 2017.

      "Pay Ratio In August 2015 pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), the SEC adopted Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median employee's annual total compensation.160 For 2017, this information is as follows: 160 160 Mr. Kiley, Chief Executive Officer, annual total compensation: $728,276 160 Median employee annual total compensation: $160 73,217 160 Ratio of Chief Executive Officer to median employee compensation: 160160160160 160160 10:1 160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160 In determining the median employee, we used a listing of all active employees, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, as of December 31, 2017.160 To identify our median employee, we included total cash compensation received plus company-paid contributions to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, life insurance premiums paid on employees' behalf, 401(k) plan company match, company-funded health savings account and cell phone allowance as our consistently applied compensation measure. As a result of the flexibility permitted by Item 402(u), the method we used to determine our median employee may differ from the methods used by our peers, so the ratios may not be comparable. Compensation Policies and Risk We believe that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on First Financial.160 In addition, the Compensation and Awards Committee believes that the mix and design elements of the executive compensation package do not encourage management to assume excessive risks.160 As described in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation decisions are subjective, based on peer group compensation data, institutional profitability, management development, market measurements and overall corporate performance.160 The primary objective of the Compensation 160 28 and Awards Committee is for management to be fairly compensated.160 We have accomplished this by maintaining base salaries in the upper tier range of published peer groups, by providing excellent employee medical and other related benefits, by granting personal days off and by offering participation in our ESOP. Incentive compensation for Mr. Kiley and the named executive officers is determined by the Compensation and Awards Committee after its analysis of a number of financial measures, including but not necessarily limited to profitability, efficiency, growth, asset quality trends, peer group performance, satisfactory regulatory standing and current market conditions. First Financial's incentive compensation program provides specific goals and corresponding payout potential to production oriented lending and deposit staff members.160 For non-production staff, incentive pay is based on progress towards goals set by their manager for each individual, for completion of Community Reinvestment Act related service hours, and the Company's achievement on selected corporate performance measures.160 This approach is intended to ensure that every employee focuses on the performance of First Financial. Compensation and Awards Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The members of the Compensation and Awards Committee are Directors Stevens, Molvar and Riccobono.160 None of the members of the Compensation and Awards Committee of the First Financial Board of Directors has served as an officer or employee of First Financial or any of its subsidiaries or had any relationships otherwise requiring disclosure.

      "Pay RatioIn August 2015 pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the 8220Dodd - Frank Act8221), the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee8217s annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of the principal executive officer (8220PEO8221). The Company8217s PEO is Mr. Riley.160 Registrants must comply with the pay ratio rule for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.160 The purpose of the new required disclosure is to provide a measure of the equitability of pay within the organization.160 In determining the median employee, a listing was prepared of all employees as of December 11, 2017. Wages and benefits were annualized for those employees not employed for the full year of 2017.160There were 465 employees acquired through the Bank of the Cascades acquisition who were excluded from the list. The median amount was selected from the resulting list.16040For purposes of determining total compensation, the following earnings were included:Base SalaryShort-Term IncentiveLong-Term Incentive comprised of stock awardsOther Compensation comprised of:8226Contributions by us to our qualified profit sharing and employee savings plans, under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code8226Contributions by us to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan8226Premiums paid by us for individual long-term care plans8226Dividends on unvested restricted stock8226Income from amounts paid by us for social club dues, signing bonuses, and moving/relocation expensesMedian Employee Total Annual CompensationPEO Total Annual CompensationRatio of PEO to Median Employee Total Annual Compensation$50,483$1,796,04035.6:1Employment AgreementsUpon his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Riley. Under the terms of the employment agreement, Mr. Riley is entitled to annual base compensation of $678,000, subject to periodic review and adjustment, a one-time award of 10,818 shares of the Company8217s time-restricted Class A common stock vesting one-third on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date and additional benefits as are customarily offered to the Company8217s executives, including paid time off, health insurance, 401(k) and profit sharing plans or benefits, use of a Company car and a social club membership. Mr. Riley's employment agreement provides for the establishment of a non-qualified defined contribution supplemental executive retirement plan (\"SERP\"), which became effective on January 1, 2016. The SERP provides for annual year-end contributions equal to 20% of Mr. Riley8217s base salary and performance-contingent contributions of up to an additional 20% of base salary dependent upon achievement of established performance goals as determined by the Compensation Committee. Both annual contributions and performance-contingent contributions to the SERP are 0% vested until the fourth anniversary of the date of establishment, at which time the balance will become 50% vested. The SERP will vest 10% per year thereafter and become fully vested on the ninth anniversary of the date of establishment conditioned on continuous service. The SERP is adjusted for investment earnings or losses based upon the performance of the underlying investments selected by Mr. Riley from among alternatives selected by the plan administrator. Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of ControlThe amount of compensation payable to the Named Executive Officers upon voluntary termination, retirement, involuntary not-for-cause termination, termination following a change of control and in the event of disability or death of the executives is explained below. The amounts included below are estimates of the amounts which would be paid out to the Named Executive Officers upon voluntary termination, retirement, involuntary not-for-cause termination, or termination following a change of control assuming that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2017 and thus includes amounts earned through such time.

      "Pay Ratio. We believe executive pay must be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our employees to create shareholder value. We are committed to internal pay equity, and the Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay our executive officers receive and the pay all other employees receive. 15 In accordance with the requirements of the Dodd8211Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd-Frank Act\"), we are required to include an analysis of our Chief Executive Officer to median employee pay ratio in our Proxy Statement. This ratio is calculated in accordance with what the SEC requires pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on December 31, 2017. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. We annualized the compensation for full-time employees who were not employed with us for all of 2017, but did not annualize the compensation for any part-time or seasonal employees. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure. After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers, and specifically our Chief Executive Officer, as set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table provided later in this Proxy Statement. Based on this methodology, our calculated 2017 Chief Executive Officer to median employee pay ratio is 13.8:1. Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis above with management. Based on that review and discussion, we recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

Mercer is owned by Marshamp McLennan Companies,Inc., a multi-services global professional services firm providing advice and solutions in risk, strategy and human capital. For a discussion of amounts paid to Mercer for executive and  46 Table of Contents  director compensation consulting services and amounts paid to MMC (which includes Marshamp McLennan Companies,Inc. and its affiliates) for non-executive and non-director compensation consulting services, please see, 147Board Committees 151Compensation Committee151Relationship with Compensation Consultants.148 The Compensation Committee has determined that the provision by MMC of services unrelated to executive and director compensation matters in fiscal year 2018 was compatible with maintaining the objectivity of Mercer in its role as compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee and that the consulting advice it received from Mercer was not influenced by MMC146s other relationships with the Company. The Compensation Committee has retained Mercer as its independent compensation consultant for fiscal year 2019 and expects that it will continue to retain an independent compensation consultant on future executive compensation matters.  Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions  The Compensation Committee makes recommendations to our Board on all compensation actions relating to our executive officers. As part of its process, the Compensation Committee meets with our Chief Executive Officer and other executives to obtain recommendations with respect to the structure of our compensation programs, as well as an assessment of the performance of individual executives and recommendations on compensation for individual executives. As discussed in greater detail below under 147Fiscal Year 2018 Executive Compensation151Incentive Bonus Plan,148 our Chief Executive Officer and other executives develop recommendations for performance measures and target payout opportunities under our incentive bonus plan based on management146s business forecast both at the Company and business unit levels, which are reviewed and approved by our Board.  Competitive Positioning  In arriving at its recommendations to our Board on the amounts and components of compensation for our Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers competitive compensation data prepared by Mercer. The Compensation Committee reviews this data in the context of historical performance and our overall compensation programs and objectives. The Compensation Committee considered the following competitive compensation data for our NEOs:  183160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160 Mercer constructed a peer group consisting of 17 companies based on targeting firms with a high degree of complexity in business scale and scope, as well as similar revenues, numbers of employees, and returns on invested capital.  183160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160 The Compensation Committee also takes into account Mercer146s review of standardized surveys to check the Company146s compensation programs against other large high technology and durable goods manufacturing firms to gain an understanding of general compensation practices.  Each year, the peer companies are recommended by the Compensation Committee146s independent consultant and approved by the Compensation Committee. For the fiscal year 2018 peer group, Tyco International Ltd was removed as it and another of Flex146s peer146s, Johnson Controls International plc, merged.

The pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We used the following methodology in calculating the ratio:   1. We included all employees active as of December31, 2017, with the exception of our chief executive officer, to identify the median employee. We did not include (i)employees with 2017 compensation who were no longer active as of December31, 2017, (ii) contract labor employees, (iii)independent distributors or (iv)leased labor employees. We do not have any employees located outside of the United States.   2. We found the median employee using 2017 gross compensation reported to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for the period of January1, 2017 to December31, 2017. Specifically, we used Form W-2, Box 5, Medicare Wages and Tips.   3. The compensation reported for our chief executive officer is from the Summary Compensation Table on page 36 of this proxy statement and also includes employer-provided health and wellness benefits. The compensation reported for the median employee is the total amount of compensation paid to the median employee during the period of January1, 2017 to December31, 2017 and also includes employer-provided health and wellness benefits.

Occasionally we may sign a letter agreement with a new executive upon hiring, but generally such an agreement does not cover more than the first year146s pay and bonus, and confirmation of eligibility to participate in our long-term incentive program. Change in Control Agreements All of the NEOs (other than Mr.Tomnitz and Mr.Bartok) have change in control/severance agreements. For a description of the terms of these change in control/severance agreements, see the 147Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control148 section beginning on page 48 of this Proxy Statement. We believe that the  34 Table of Contents change in control/severance agreements help us to attract and retain our executives by reducing the personal uncertainty and anxiety that arises from the possibility of a future business combination. During a potential change in control, we would not want executives leaving to pursue other employment out of concern for the security of their jobs or being unable to concentrate on their work. To enable executives to focus on the best interest of our stockholders, we offer change in control agreements that generally provide severance benefits to executives whose employment terminates as a result of a change in control. Perquisites We generally provide minimal perquisites to our executives. Please see the Summary Compensation Table on page 40 for a description of 2017 perquisites. Clawback Policy If an executive leaves under circumstances that call into question whether any compensation amounts paid to him or her were validly earned, we would pursue any legal rights we deemed appropriate under the circumstances. Oversight of Executive Compensation Compensation Committee Our Compensation Committee oversees executive compensation. Our Compensation Committee is composed entirely of independent, outside directors and establishes and administers our compensation programs and philosophies. Our Executive Chairman (or, before the Merger, our CEO) works closely with our Compensation Committee and recommends executive compensation amounts, except that our Executive Chairman (or, before the Merger, our CEO) does not participate in discussions regarding his own compensation. Our Executive Chairman (or, before the Merger, our CEO) consults with the other executive officers about compensation amounts for executives and other employees who report to them. Our Compensation Committee will also consider the results of stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation. Our Compensation Committee has final approval of all compensation amounts or formulas applicable to benefit plans in which executive officers participate. Our Compensation Committee also:   149  establishes, administers, and approves bonus programs for non-executive employees and approves the aggregate amount of bonus pool for the Company. Each executive officer recommends individual bonus amounts for employees under his or her direction, and our Executive Chairman (or, before the Merger, our CEO) approves or adjusts the individual amounts   149  approves all equity-based award recipients and the amount of each award   149  delegates to our Executive Chairman (or, before the Merger, our CEO) the responsibility for approving health and welfare programs for all employees. Executive officers participate in the same health and welfare programs as other salaried employees and   149  delegates to certain of our executive officers the responsibility of maintaining the tax qualification status of our 401(k) plan, approving 401(k) plan provisions and formulas applicable to employees who are not executive officers, and overseeing the administration of the 401(k) and other benefit plans. In addition, a retirement plan investment committee oversees 401(k) plan fund choices. This investment committee reports annually to the Compensation Committee. Competitive Pay Analysis and Peer Group We employ several methods to evaluate our executive compensation practices relative to those in other companies. Our Compensation Committee, either alone or with the assistance of a compensation consultant, may  35 Table of Contents conduct an analysis of the NEOs to assist with setting compensation for the NEOs. For further comparison, we evaluate the base salary, annual incentive bonus awards, and long-term incentives provided to the NEOs of the companies in our peer group, although we do not target our pay toward any particular peer group benchmark.

      "Pay RatioAs required by applicable SEC rules, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the total annual compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO.For 2017, our last completed fiscal year:8226the median of the annual total compensation of our employees (other than our CEO) was $5,833 and8226the total annual compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included elsewhere in this proxy statement is $8,543,343.Based on this information, for 2017 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees was 1,46532to 1. We took the following steps to identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO. 1.We determined that, as of November 30, 2017, our employee population consisted of approximately 39,08932individuals. This population consisted of full time, part time, temporary and seasonal employees employed with us as of the determination date. 80% of the total employee population are from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Kenya and the Philippines. The remaining 20% of the total employee population are from the remaining 33 countries where we operate. 2.To identify the \"median employee\" from our employee population, we used a statistical sampling methodology that considered a representative sampling of our employees in each country where we are located. The total sampling size consisted of 21732employees. To identify the median employee from the sampled group, we used \"gross wages\" as reflected in our payroll records for the eleven month period beginning January 1, 2017 to November 1, 2017. For this purpose, \"gross wages\" generally refers to the total amount of compensation the employee was paid before taxes, deductions, insurance 44Table of Contentspremiums, and other payroll withholding. Gross wages in local currency were converted to US dollars using closing exchange rates on November 30, 2017.3.For the annual total compensation of our median employee, we identified and calculated the elements of that employee's compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x), resulting in annual total compensation of $5,833. Since the median employee is located in Costa Rica, we converted the employee's pay from the local currency to U.S. dollars using the closing exchange rates on November 30, 2017. 4.For the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the \"Total\" column of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement. 45Table of ContentsEQUITY COMPENSATION PLANSThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company8217s equity compensation plans as of December16029, 2017, the end of the Company8217s most recently completed fiscal year:Plan category160Number160of160securitiesto be issued uponexercise ofoutstanding160options,warrants and rights160Weighted-averageexercise price ofoutstanding160options,warrants and rights160Number of securities remainingavailable160for160future160 issuance160underequity compensation plans(excluding securities reflected incolumn (a))160160160(a)160(b)160(c)160Equity compensation plans approved by security holders(1)160979,980(2)160$251601,339,968(3)160Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders160001600160Total160979,980160$251601,339,968160160_______________(1)Equity compensation plans approved by security holders include the Company's 1999 Share Incentive Plans and the 2011 and 2014 Omnibus Share Incentive Plans.

      "Pay Ratio The pay ratio information is provided pursuant to Item402(u) of RegulationS-K. We note that, due to our permitted use of reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing this pay ratio 74 disclosure, the disclosure may involve a degree of imprecision, and thus this pay ratio disclosure is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item402(u) of RegulationS-K using the data and assumptions described below. The pay ratio was not used to make management decisions and the Board does not use this pay ratio to make executive compensation decisions. To determine the median employee, we evaluated the year to date base salary, overtime and bonus compensation (other than bonuses under our Management Incentive Plan, which were not widely distributed) earned by our full-time, part-time and temporary employees (other than our Chief Executive Officer) that were employed by us on October1, 2017. We adjusted the compensation of permanent employees who were not employed for the full nine month period to reflect the estimated compensation they would have earned had those permanent employees been employed for the full nine month period, as permitted by the applicable SEC rules. In calculating the compensation used to identify the median employee, the Company used Indian Rupee to U.S. Dollar and Pound Sterling to U.S. Dollar exchange rates as of September30, 2017 the Company did not make any cost-of-living adjustments for the employees included in the compensation evaluation. Mr.Walden had 2017 annual total compensation of $11,110,720. This amount equals his compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table above, plus an additional amount that reflects the annualization of his base salary, non-equity incentive plan compensation and health benefits, consistent with applicable SEC requirements. Our median employee's annual total compensation for 2017 was $62,361. As a result, we estimate that Mr.Walden's 2017 annual total compensation was approximately 178times that of our median employee. 75 RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS Related-Party Transactions Policies and Procedures Pursuant to our Code of Ethics, without full disclosure and prior written approval, our executive officers and directors are not permitted to make any investment, accept any position or benefits, participate in any transaction or business arrangement or otherwise act in a manner that creates or appears to create a conflict of interest. Our executive officers and directors are required to make such disclosure to, and receive the prior written approval of, our General Counsel and the Chair of the Audit Committee, or such other individual or committee of the Board of Directors as may be designated by the Board of Directors with respect to any related-party transactions. A current copy of the Code of Ethics is available on our corporate website (www.ftdcompanies.com) under \"Investor Relations.\" In addition, each year, our directors and executive officers are required to complete Director and Officer Questionnaires that, among other things, identify any potential related-party transactions. Our Board of Directors determines, on an annual basis, which members of our Board meet the definition of an independent director as defined in the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. Pursuant to our Audit Committee's written charter, our Audit Committee is charged with monitoring and reviewing issues involving potential conflicts of interest, and reviewing and approving any potential related-party transactions which could be required to be disclosed under Item404 of RegulationS-K, unless such transactions have been approved by a comparable committee of the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors as a whole. A copy of the Audit Committee's written charter is available on our corporate website (www.ftdcompanies.com) under \"Investor Relations.\" Under Item404 of RegulationS-K, a related-party transaction is defined as any transaction or proposed transaction in which the company was or is to be a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any of the following had or will have a direct or indirect material interest: the company's directors, director nominees, executive officers, greater than five percent beneficial owners or any immediate family member of any of the foregoing.

      "Pay Ratio SEC rules newly require companies to disclose the ratio of the total annual compensation of the principal executive officer to the median employee8217s total annual compensation. We identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 23, 2017, the last day of our payroll year. We included all employees. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation, and we did not annualize the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2017. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees. After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table above. The total annual compensation of the median employee for 2017 was $63,130. The total annual compensation including bonuses for our CEO for 2017 was $955,093. The ratio of CEO pay to the median employee pay for 2017 was approximately 15. Accounting and Tax Considerations In designing our compensation programs, we take into consideration the accounting and tax effect that each element will or may have on us and the executive officers and other employees as a group. We aim to keep the expense related to our compensation programs as a whole within certain affordability levels. When determining how to apportion between differing elements of compensation, our goal is to meet our objectives while maintaining relative cost neutrality. For instance, if we increase benefits under one program resulting in higher compensation expense, we may seek to decrease costs under another program in order to avoid a compensation expense that is above the level then deemed affordable under existing circumstances. With respect to stock option and restricted stock awards, we recognize a charge to earnings for accounting purposes equally from the grant date until the end of the vesting period. We believe we have structured our current compensation program to comply with Internal Revenue Code Sections 162(m) and 409A. Under Section160162(m), a limitation is placed on tax deductions of any publicly-held corporation for individual compensation to certain executives of such corporation exceeding $1,000,000 in any taxable year, except the deduction limitation historically did not apply to performance-based compensation that met certain requirements. As part of the tax reform legislation passed in December 2017, the exemption from Section 162(m)8217s deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to covered executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. If an executive is entitled to nonqualified deferred compensation benefits that are subject to Section160409A, and such benefits do not comply with Section160409A, then the benefits are taxable in the first year they are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. In such case, the service provider is subject to regular federal income tax, interest and an additional federal income tax of 20% of the benefit includible in income. During 2017, we do not believe we had covered employees with compensation paid in excess of the Section 162(m) tax deduction limit had the new rules been in effect during 2017. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation During 2017, our compensation committee was comprised of Ms. Frank (chairperson), Mr. Maisel and Mr. Sutherland. None of the members of our compensation committee has at any time been an officer or employee of our company or has any interlocking relationships that are subject to disclosure under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to compensation committees. Compensation Committee Report Our compensation committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for 2017. Based on the review and discussions, our compensation committee recommended to the board, 18  and the board has approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December16031, 2017 and this proxy statement.

      "Pay Ratio  The 2017 annual total compensation of the median compensated of all our employees who were employed as of December 31, 2017, other than our CEO, Mr. Hall, was $126,646 Mr. Hallrsquos 2017 annual total compensation was $11,874,230 and the ratio of these amounts was 1-to-94.  The SECrsquos rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employeersquos annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.  The pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records, and the methodology described below. For these purposes, we identified the median compensated employee using the base salary determined as of December 31, 2017 and target cash incentives for the 2017 performance year, which amounts were annualized for any employee who did not work for the entire year. Our employee population consisted of all worldwide associates of heritage Gartner (i.e., we excluded 4,617 CEB associates since 2017 was the year of the acquisition). Based on our consistently applied compensation measure, we identified a group of 10 associates within 0.2% of the median amount and calculated annual total compensation in accordance with Summary Compensation Table requirements for these associates to identify our median compensated employee. 44 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION  The following table provides information as of December 31, 2017 regarding the number of shares of our Common Stock that may be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, stock appreciation rights and other rights (including restricted stock units, performance stock units and common stock equivalents) awarded under our equity compensation plans (and, where applicable, related weighted-average exercise price information), as well as shares available for future issuance under our equity compensation plans.

(2) Column A includes 1,183,998 SARs, 1,607,817 PSUs and RSUs, and 109,014 CSEs. Because there is no exercise price associated with PSUs, RSUs or CSEs, these stock awards are not included in the weighted-average exercise price calculation presented in column B.   (3) In addition, the Company has outstanding equity compensation awards that the Company assumed in the acquisition of CEB. These awards were granted by CEB under its 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the ldquoCEB Planrdquo) in the period between 2012 to the closing of the acquisition by the Company and were converted into an adjusted number of Company shares. As of December 31, 2017, there were a total of 386,083 Company shares subject to assumed CEB restricted stock units. No additional restricted stock units, options or other awards have been granted under the CEB Plan since the closing of the acquisition and no new awards will be granted in the future under that plan. 45 PROPOSAL TWO:  APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS  In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act (which was added by the Dodd-Frank Act) and the related rules of the SEC, we are including in this Proxy Statement a separate resolution subject to stockholder vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs.

Employee Benefit and Stock Plans Amended and Restated 2015 Equity Incentive Plan See \"Proposal 3151Summary of 2015 Plan\" above. Inducement Plan Our board of directors adopted the Inducement Plan in September 2016. Pursuant to the Inducement Plan, as amended, we have reserved 450,000 shares of common stock to be used exclusively for grants of awards to individuals who were not previously employees or directors of the Company, as an inducement material to the individual's entry into employment with the Company within the meaning of Rule5635(c)(4) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules. The Inducement Plan was approved, amended and can be further amended to increase the number of shares reserved thereunder at any time by our board of directors without stockholder approval pursuant to Rule5635(c)(4) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules. The terms and conditions of the Inducement Plan are substantially similar to our 2015 Plan, which was approved by our stockholders. 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In April 2016, our board of directors and stockholders approved the 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), in order to enable eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount following the date of our initial public offering. The ESPP became effective on August4, 2016. The purpose of the ESPP is to retain the services of new employees and secure the services of new and existing employees while providing incentives for such individuals to exert maximum efforts toward our success and that of our affiliates. Share Reserve.The ESPP authorizes the issuance of 300,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to our employees or to employees of any of our designated affiliates. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance will automatically increase on January1 of each calendar year through January1, 2026 by the least of (1)1.0% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December31 of the preceding calendar year and (2)75,000 shares. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an \"employee stock purchase plan\" within the meaning of Section423 of the Code. As of the date hereof, no shares of our common stock have been purchased under the ESPP. Administration.Our board of directors has delegated its authority to administer the ESPP to our compensation committee. The ESPP is implemented through a series of offerings of purchase rights to eligible employees. Under the ESPP, we may specify offerings with durations of not more than 27months, and may specify shorter purchase periods within each offering. Each offering will have one or more purchase dates on which shares of our common stock will be purchased for employees participating in the offering. An offering may be terminated under certain circumstances. Payroll Deductions.Generally, all regular employees, including executive officers, employed by us or by any of our designated affiliates, may participate in the ESPP and may contribute, normally through payroll deductions, up to an amount determined by the board of directors, but not exceeding 15% of their earnings for the purchase of our common stock under the ESPP. Unless otherwise 36 Table of Contents determined by our board of directors, common stock will be purchased for accounts of employees participating in the ESPP at a price per share equal to the lower of (1)85% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the first date of an offering or (2)85% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of purchase. Limitations.Employees may have to satisfy one or more of the following service requirements before participating in the ESPP, as determined by our board of directors: (1)customarily employed for more than 20hours per week, (2)customarily employed for more than five months per calendar year or (3)continuous employment with us or one of our affiliates for a period of time, not to exceed two years.

To identify the median employee, the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments and estimates we used were as follows: 8226 We used October 1, 2017 as the date to determine the median employee. 8226 All employees throughout our global operations were taken into account. 8226 Given the geographical distribution of our employee population, we use a variety of pay elements to structure the compensation arrangements of employees, with cash compensation being the most commonly used form of annual pay.Consequently, for purposes of measuring the compensation in determining the median employee, we selected base salary or wages, overtime and short-term incentives as the most appropriate measure of compensation.In making this determination we annualized the compensation of permanent employees hired between January 1, 2017 and October 1, 2017. 8226 Using this methodology, we determined the appropriate median employee to be a full-time U.S. employee. 8226 For purposes of this determination we applied the appropriate exchange rate to U.S. dollars of the average exchange rate for October 2017 as to our non-US employees.  When calculating the Annual Total Compensation of the CEO, we used the amount reported in the 8220Total8221 column of our Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement as well as medical premiums paid by the Company.We used the same methodology for calculating the Annual Total Compensation for the median employee.   40 8250 P.

      "PAY RATIOAs required by the SEC, we are providing the following information regarding the relationship of our median employee8217s annual total compensation compared to the annual total compensation of Mr. Wasz, our Chief Executive Officer. Identification of Median EmployeeWe selected December 31, 2017 as the date on which to determine the median employee. As of that date, we had approximately 1,980 employees (1,899 in the United States and Puerto Rico and 81 outside of the United States). For purposes of identifying the median employee, we used 2017 taxable year-to date compensation as our consistently applied compensation measure. To identify the median employee, we excluded 81 non-U.S. employees from the following jurisdictions: 33 from the Republic of China, 41 from Mexico and 7 from Singapore. After applying this exemption, we analyzed a total of 1,899 employees to determine the median employee.In determining the annual total compensation of the median employee and our Chief Executive Officer, we calculated their compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K as required by the SEC. This calculation is the same calculation used to determine annual total compensation reported above in the Summary Compensation Table for our Chief Executive Officer.

      "Pay Ratio As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer: To identify our median employee for purposes of the CEO pay ratio, we analyzed our employee population of approximately 1,288 full and part-time employees in the United States as of the mid-November 2017 payroll. For purposes of the calculation, we exclude our CEO, independent contractors whose compensation is determined by an unaffiliated third party and 27 non-U.S. employees including one in each of Australia, Germany and the UnitedArabEmirates,  63 Table of Contents two in each of Brazil, China, France and Singapore, three in Switzerland, four in Japan, and nine in the United Kingdom. The median employee was identified using total cash compensation, which we determined reasonably reflects the annual compensation of our employees and consistently applies to all our employees. The calculation of total compensation of the CEO and the median employee was determined in the same manner as the 147Total Compensation148 shown for our CEO in the 147Summary Compensation Table148 on page 40. In 2017, the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, was $2,268,463 and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company other than the CEO was $116,307. Based on this information, for 2017, the reasonable estimated ratio of annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 19.50. The pay ratio disclosed is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. The applicable rules provide issuers with a great degree of flexibility in determining the methodology and related assumptions in identifying their median employee and calculating the ratio. As a result, the pay ratio we have disclosed in this proxy statement may not be comparable to pay ratios disclosure by other companies. Director Compensation Our non-employee directors, other than the Chairman, receive an annual board retainer of $190,000, consisting of $50,000 in cash, $70,000 in stock options (based on the fair market value of the option computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718) and $70,000 in deferred share units granted under our 2013 or 2016 Omnibus Plan. The non-employee Chairman of the board is paid annual compensation of $265,000, consisting of $75,000 in cash, $95,000 in stock options and $95,000 in deferred share units granted under the Gogo Inc. Omnibus Plan or 2016 Omnibus Plan. The chairs of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee each receive additional annual cash compensation of $20,000, $15,000 and $10,000, respectively. Cash payments are paid on or shortly after the end of the quarter and equity grants are made on the last business day of the quarter. Directors may elect to receive all or a portion of the cash portion of their annual retainer and any additional payments for service as a chair in the form of deferred share units granted under our Omnibus Plan. The directors are required to retain shares received upon exercise of stock options or settlement of deferred stock units (on an after-tax net basis) until the earlier of one year following termination of board service or a change in control of the Company. This retention policy applies only to stock options and deferred stock units granted on and after September30, 2015.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE As permitted under the SEC rules, in order to identify our median team member, we used a consistently applied compensation measure of 'base pay' earned during the period from January1, 2017 to September30, 2017, rather than summary compensation table (SCT) total compensation for all of 2017. We annualized base pay for those team members who commenced work during 2017. Once we identified the median team member, we determined the median team member's full year compensation based on the compensation elements required for inclusion in the SCT, with the exception of incorporating healthcare benefits in Total Compensation as discussed later in this section. We utilized the de minimis exemption to exclude approximately 4% of our global workforce, or 920 employees, as reflected below: 149 Included in calculation: Canada, China, Mexico, Netherlands, Panama, United Kingdom, United States (23,000 team members) 149 Excluded from calculation: Belgium, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, United Arab Emirates (920 team members) In calculating Total Compensation for our median team member and CEO, we included the estimated company cost of their respective Company-provided health and wellness benefits therefore the CEO's Total Compensation for purposes of this calculation differs from the Total Compensation described in the SCT of this document by his health and wellness benefits amount. The median team member's estimated Total Compensation for 2017 was $63,577 (note that this definition includes compensation of $53,139 and estimated benefits of $10,438). The ratio of CEO pay to median team member pay is 113:1. 8203 Proxy Statement 75 Table of Contents 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203 8203  8203 CompensationDiscussionandAnalysis 8203 The Company is asking its shareholders for their non-binding advisory approval of the compensation of its Named Executive Officers (Say on Pay) as disclosed in the \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" section of this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC rules. As described in detail under \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis,\" the Company's compensation program is based upon a philosophy that is applied to all Company employees151to attract and retain the best people and provide appropriate performance-based incentives that encourage them to achieve results that create long-term shareholder value. The Company sets target compensation for the Named Executive Officers to approximate the market median of compensation at companies of similar size and complexity. Employees at all levels of the Company, including its executives, are provided clear incentives to grow the business (Sales Growth) while achieving investment returns (Return on Invested Capital or ROIC) for the Company's shareholders. The compensation program is structured to significantly reward long-term performance while not encouraging excessive risk taking. Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis/ page37 for additional details about the compensation of the Named Executive Officers. This Say on Pay vote is intended to address the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as disclosed in the \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" section of this proxy statement as a whole rather than any specific item or amount of executive compensation. We are asking our shareholders to vote \"FOR\" the following advisory resolution at the Company's 2018 annual meeting:   \"Resolved, that the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" section of this proxy statement, including the related tables, notes and narrative is hereby approved by the Company's shareholders.\" This advisory vote on the compensation of Grainger's Named Executive Officers is determined by the votes of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against the proposal. Broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote. This Say on Pay vote is advisory and non-binding on the Company, our Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of the Board. However, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised of independent directors, expect to take into account the outcome of this Say on Pay vote when making future compensation decisions regarding Grainger's Named Executive Officers.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE  The SEC issued final rulesimplementing the provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that require U.S. publicly-traded companies to disclose in their proxy statement filed beginning in 2018 the ratio of their chief executive officer146s compensation to that of their median employee.160 Because the company has no employees, disclosure pursuant to such rulesis not included in this proxy statement.  38  PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE RELATING TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  The SEC adopted rulespursuant to Section951 of the Dodd-Frank Act that require public companies to provide stockholders with periodic advisory (non-binding) votes on executive compensation, also referred to as 147say-on-pay148 proposals.  As more fully described under the sections of this proxy statement entitled 147Executive Officers148 and 147Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,148 we are externally managed by Pine River pursuant a Management Agreement and, consequently, we do not have any employees and have not paid any cash compensation directly to any of our named executive officers. Each named executive officer146s compensation is comprised of cash compensation paid to them directly by160 Pine River and equity awards granted by our company pursuant to our Equity Incentive Plan. The amount of cash compensation paid to each named executive officer is determined by and is the responsibility of Pine River and the amount of the equity awards granted to each named executive officer is determined by our Compensation Committee. For more information regarding our executive compensation, please see 147Executive Officers148 above.  Accordingly, we are asking you to vote 147FOR148 the adoption of the following resolution:  147RESOLVED:That the stockholders of the company approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation paid to the company146s executive officers, as disclosed in the company146s proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rulesof the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related narrative discussions in the proxy statement.148  Because this say-on-pay vote is advisory in nature, it is not binding on us, our Board of Directors, our Compensation Committee, or Pine River. Our Board of Directors has determined that our company will hold an advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis. We currently expect to conduct our next advisory vote on executive compensation at our next annual meeting of stockholders in May2019, though we will take into consideration the outcome of the advisory vote under Proposal 3 of this proxy statement.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE 147FOR148 THE ADVISORY VOTE RELATED TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.   PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES RELATING TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  In accordance with SEC rules, we are providing our stockholders with an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation, such as that provided for in Proposal 2 of this proxy statement. This non-binding advisory vote is commonly referred to as a 147say on frequency148 vote. Under this proposal, stockholders may vote to have the company hold an advisory vote on executive compensation: (i)every year (ii)every two years or (iii)every three years. The option that receives the highest number of votes cast will reflect the frequency for future say-on-pay votes that has been selected by our stockholders.  This vote on the frequency of future advisory votes relating to executive compensation is advisory in nature and is not binding on us, our Board of Directors, our Compensation Committee, or Pine River.  39  However, our Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions expressed by our stockholders in their vote on this proposal, and expect to take into account the outcome of this vote when considering the frequency of future advisory votes on our executive compensation.  While we will continue to monitor developments in this area, our Board believes that a say-on-pay vote should be conducted every year so that our stockholders may express their views on our executive compensation program and our Compensation Committee can consider the outcome of these votes in making its decisions on executive compensation.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR A FREQUENCY OF 147EVERY YEAR148 WITH RESPECT TO THE SAY-ON-PAY VOTE.

      "Pay Ratio We believe our executive compensation program must be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our employees to create stockholder value. We monitor the relationship between the compensation of our executive officers and the compensation of our non-managerial employees. For the year ended March31, 2018, the total compensation of Lee-Lean Shu, our President and Chief Executive Officer, of $697,837, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table above, was approximately 6.5 times the total compensation of the median employee calculated in the same manner of $107,966. Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with SEC's rules pursuant to Item402(u) of RegulationS-K. We identified the median employee by examining the 2018 total compensation for all of our employees , excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on March31, 2018, the last day of our payroll year. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total compensation. We annualized the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2018. 29 Table of Contents Compensation of Directors Our policy for the compensation of non-employee directors provides that non-employee directors are entitled to receive annual cash retainers as follows: Board  $40,000  Lead Director  $20,000  Audit Committee:     149 Chair  $20,000  149 Other Members  $7,500  Compensation Committee:     149 Chair  $10,000  149 Other Members  $5,000  Nominating and Governance Committee:     149 Chair  $7,500  149 Other Members  $3,000  Prior to fiscal 2017, each new non-employee director was granted an initial option to purchase 10,000 shares of our common stock upon his or her initial election or appointment to our Board of Directors, which option was exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Under the Board's prior policy, at the first regular quarterly meeting of the Board of Directors following each annual meeting of stockholders, each non-employee director who remained in office immediately following such annual meeting of stockholders was granted an additional option to purchase 2,000 shares of common stock, which became fully vested and exercisable on August15 of the following year, subject to the non-employee director's continuous service on our Board of Directors. In addition, each non-employee director was granted an option to purchase (i)an additional 2,000 shares in any fiscal year in which the non-employee director was serving as the chairman or lead director of the Board, (ii)an additional 1,000 shares in any fiscal year for each committee of the Board on which the non-employee director was then serving, other than as chairman of the committee, and (iii)an additional 2,000 shares in any fiscal year for each committee of the Board on which the non-employee director was then serving as chairman of the committee. Upon stockholder approval of the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan in August 2016, the Board revised the policy for the annual grant of options so that each non-employee director will receive an option to purchase the number of shares having a fair market value equal to the aggregate amount of the annual cash retainer payable to such director for service on the Board and its committees. The table below summarizes the compensation we paid to our non-employee directors for the fiscal year ended March31, 2018.

      "Pay Ratio We believe our executive compensation program must be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our employees to create stockholder value. We monitor the relationship between the compensation of our executive officers and the compensation of our non-managerial employees. For 2017, the total compensation of Jeffrey Eckel, our president and chief executive officer of $4,199,224, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table above, (the 8220CEO Compensation8221), was approximately 17160times the total compensation of a median employee calculated in the same manner of $243,102. We identified the median employee using the annual base salary and expected bonus, as of December16031, 2017, plus any long-term incentive stock awards granted in 2017 for all individuals, excluding our chief executive officer, who were employed by us on December16031, 2017, the last day of our payroll year (whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis). If such median employee8217s total compensation was not comparable to the CEO Compensation, for example, because such median employee was hired at the end of the year and thus did not receive long-term incentive stock awards in 2017, we used the next lower employee who was comparable as the median employee. After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our CEO Compensation. 160- 38 -Stock Ownership Guidelines for Named Executive Officers and Directors In March 2016, our board of directors adopted stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs and directors, which are intended to further align their interests with the interests of our stockholders. Under the guidelines, each NEO must hold an ownership stake in the Company that is significant in comparison to their base salary and each director must hold an ownership stake in the Company that is significant in comparison to the cash portion of their fees. The aggregate value of stock ownership required to be retained is shown below: 8226Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President: six times base salary 8226 all other NEOs: three times base salary and 8226all other directors: five times the cash retainer. Each NEO and director has five years to comply from the later of the date they become covered under this policy or the date the policy was adopted. Until the individual is in compliance, NEOs must retain 50%, and directors must retain 100%, of any equity grants, net of any shares withheld or sold to satisfy taxes. Stock ownership for the purpose of these guidelines includes stock, restricted stock and OP units held by the covered individual but excluding any RSUs. As of April1605, 2018, each of our NEOs and Messrs. Cirilli, O8217Neil, Osborne and Osgood were in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines. Mses.160Blalock and Brenner have until 2022 and 2021, respectively to achieve compliance. 160- 39 -SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE Section16016(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (822010% Holders8221) to file with the SEC and the NYSE initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of Common Stock and other equity securities of the Company. Directors, executive officers and 10% Holders are required by the SEC8217s regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section16016(a) forms and amendments thereto filed during any given year. Based on the review of copies of the Section16016(a) reports and amendments thereto furnished to us and/or written representations from our directors, executive officers and 10% Holders that no other reports were required to be filed, we believe that for the year ended December16031, 2017, our directors, executive officers and 10% Holders complied with all Section16016(a) filing requirements applicable to them. 160- 40 -CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS Indemnification Agreements for Officers and Directors We have entered into indemnification agreements with members of our board of directors and our executive officers. These indemnification agreements provide indemnification to these persons by us to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law and certain procedures for indemnification, including advancement by us of certain expenses relating to claims brought against these persons under certain circumstances. 160- 41 -SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT The following table sets forth information as of April1605, 2018 regarding the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock by (i)160each person known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock, (ii)160our NEOs, (iii)160our directors and (iv)160all of our directors and NEOs as a group.

      "Pay Ratio DisclosureAt December16031, 2017, we had over 54,00032employees, all located in the United States. Our diverse employee population varies significantly in experience, education, specialized training and status (full-time, part-time or temporary). Regardless of the employee8217s role in the organization or their location, the process for setting employee compensation is the same: local market competitive data is reviewed to set base pay rates. Individual compensation is then adjusted from these base pay rates to reflect the individual8217s role and responsibilities, as well as his or her experience, education, specialized training and overall performance. We determined the total annual compensation for our employees for the year ending December16031, 201732using data from our payroll records for the month of December 2017, which we then extrapolated for the full year of 2017. The components of total annual compensation for our employees are the same as those used to determine the total compensation of our NEOs for the purposes of the Summary Compensation table. We did not annualize the compensation for employees in temporary positions or make any full-time equivalent adjustments. The results were then ranked, excluding the President and Chief Executive Officer, from lowest to highest, and the median employee was identified. We then compared the total annual compensation of the median employee to that of the President and Chief Executive Officer. The total annual compensation of the median employee for the year ended December16031, 201732was $19,271. For the year ended December16031, 2017, the ratio of our President and Chief Executive Officer8217s total annual compensation to that of our median employee was approximately 179:1.The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee8217s total annual compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 25160Executive CompensationSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENTThe following table sets forth information as of April1602, 2018, regarding the beneficial ownership of Common Stock by each person or group known by the Company to own: (i)1605% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (ii)160each director and director nominee of the Company, (iii)160the Named Executive Officers as defined in Item160402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K and (iv)160all current directors and executive officers of the Company as a group.

      "PAY RATIO FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 Pay Ratio Our CEO to median employee pay ratio has been calculated in accordance with the recently adopted rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and is calculated in a manner consistent with Item402(u) of RegulationS-K. Mr.Mininberg's annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table above, was $6,807,095. The median Helen of Troy Limited employee's annual total compensation in fiscal year 2018 (other than Mr.Mininberg) was $51,585, calculated using the same methodology as used in the calculation of the Summary Compensation Table, consisting of base salary, bonus, stock awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, and all other compensation. As a result, the ratio of Mr.Mininberg's annual total compensation in fiscal year 2018 to the median annual total compensation of all Helen of Troy Limited employees (other than Mr.Mininberg) in fiscal year 2018 was 131.96, when calculated in a manner consistent with Item402(u) of RegulationS-K. Identification of Median Employee For purposes of determining the median Helen of Troy Limited employee, we evaluated all employees, other than Mr.Mininberg, employed by the Company as of February28, 2018 and calculated each such employee's annual total compensation received from March1, 2017 through February28, 2018. Annual total compensation consists of total cash compensation, including actual wages earned (including overtime), annual performance based incentive cash actually received, holiday cash bonuses and one time bonuses (excluding 401(k) plan matching contributions). We did not make any material assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to annual total compensation and we annualized the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of fiscal year 2018. The annual total compensation of each employee other than Mr.Mininberg was then ranked lowest to highest to determine the median employee. 61 Table of Contents Annual Total Compensation After identifying the median employee based on annual total compensation, as described above, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our Named Executive Officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table above. COMPENSATION RISKS The Company has reviewed and assessed its compensation policies and practices to determine whether they are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company's management reviews compensation policies for the presence of certain elements that could encourage employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks the ratios and level of incentive to fixed compensation, annual to long-term compensation and cash to equity compensation and the comparison of compensation expense to earnings of the Company. Management's assessment of the Company's compensation policies is reviewed by the Compensation Committee as part of its risk oversight function. The Company believes that its compensation programs for employees and executive officers are appropriately tailored to encourage employees to grow our business, but not to encourage them to do so in a way that poses unnecessary or excessive material risk. In particular, the Company's compensation programs are designed to provide the following: elements that reward short-term and long-term performance for our executive officers, incentive compensation that rewards individual and Company performance incentive or equity compensation awards that vest based on performance and/or over time and compensation with fixed and variable components, so that executive officers and key employees have both competitive remuneration to encourage retention and opportunities to earn more by successfully executing the Company's business strategy. Overall, the Compensation Committee does not believe that the compensation policies and practices give rise to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In reaching this conclusion, the Compensation Committee noted that: 149 Our compensation program is designed to provide a balanced mix of base salary, annual cash incentive compensation and long-term equity incentives, which provides the in\n",

The table below sets forth the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to that of our median employee for the year ended December16030, 2017.160160160Annual total compensation of the CEO for fiscal 2017160$4,631,867(1)160160Annual total compensation of the median employee for fiscal 2017160$58,475160160Ratio of CEO total annual compensation to the annual total compensation of the Company's median employee for fiscal 201716079:1(1) Includes one-time restricted stock award with a grant date fair value of $3,535,000 to Mr. Recatto as part of his employment agreement. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in good faith, and in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation160S-K, based on the Company's payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. The SEC rules for identifying the \"median employee\" and calculating the pay ratio based on the employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio set forth above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the \"median employee,\" as of December 30, 2017 we chose gross compensation as our consistently applied compensation measure which includes salary, regular and hourly wages, overtime, shift differentials, commissions, bonus and other miscellaneous cash earnings.160We then annualized total wages for those employees who commenced work during fiscal 2017 and any employees who were on leave for a portion of 2017.160Our total number of active US employees was 1,274. For hourly employees, we used a reasonable estimate of hours worked to determine annual base pay. Total fiscal 2017 compensation for our CEO included a one-time restricted stock award with a grant date fair value of $3,535,000 in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement. The Board did not take into account the CEO pay ratio in setting the compensation of our named executive officers.22Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2017160The table below sets forth specific information with respect to each grant of an award made under any of our plans to our named executive officers for performance in fiscal year 2017.160160160160160160Estimated Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards160Estimated Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards160Grant Date160Fair Value of Other Stock Awards(4)160160160160160160160160Grant Date160160160(1)160(2)160160160160160160160160160160160160Name160160Type of Award160ThresholdTargetMaximum160ThresholdTargetMaximum160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160Brian Recatto1602/1/2017160Restricted Stock (3)1608212821282121608212$3,535,000$3,535,000160$3,535,0001601602/23/2018160Restricted Stock1608212821282121608212$350,000$525,000160$525,000160160160160Non-equity incentive bonus160821282128212160821282128212160160John Lucks1602/23/2018160Restricted Stock1608212821282121608212$208,064$312,096160$312,096160160160160Non-equity incentive bonus1608212$152,047$228,0701608212821282121608212Mark DeVita1602/23/2018160Restricted Stock1608212821282121608212$107,811$161,717160$161,717160160160160Non-equity incentive bonus1608212$94,334$141,5021608212821282121608212Ellie Bruce1602/23/2018160Restricted Stock1608212821282121608212$109,275$163,912160$163,912160160160160Non-equity incentive bonus1608212$103,204$154,8061608212821282121608212Tom Hillstrom1602/23/2018160Restricted Stock1608212821282121608212$62,916$94,374160$94,374160160160160Non-equity incentive bonus1608212$41,944$62,9161608212821282121608212(1)Reflects the targeted amounts of non-equity incentive plan awards under the 2017 Annual Incentive Plan.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSUREUnder Dodd-Frank and Regulation S-K, we are required to disclose certain information related to the ratio of compensation to our Chief Executive Officer and our other employees (the \"Ratio Disclosure\"). We calculated the median total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2017 for all of our employees as of December 31, 2017, excluding the employees of our Swiss subsidiary, who represented less than 5% of our total employees, as well as our Chief Executive Officer, in the manner described in the \"Summary Compensation Table\" above. Using this data, we determined the Ratio Disclosure median employee (the \"Median Employee\") total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2017 to be $50,722, as follows: \"Salary\" of $50,488, \"All Other Compensation\" of $234 and all other columns in the \"Summary Compensation Table\" with a value of zero. The Ratio Disclosure for total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2017 for our Chief Executive Officer is $3,968,476 as further described in our \"Summary Compensation Table\" above. The Ratio Disclosure ratio of total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2017 for our Median Employee to that of our Chief Executive Officer was 1:78.2. We also calculated total compensation in the manner described in the \"Historical Compensation Table\" above for the Median Employee and determined total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2017 for our Median Employee to be $50,722, as follows: \"Salary\" of $50,488, \"All Other Compensation\" of $234 and all other columns in the \"Historical Compensation Table\" above with a value of zero. Using the same approach, total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2017 for our Chief Executive Officer is $477,697 as further described in our \"Historical Compensation Table\" above.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mark D. Wang, our President and Chief Executive Officer. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. To identify the 147median employee148 for 2017, our last completed fiscal year, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the median employee, the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used are described below. We determined that, as of October1, 2017, our employee population consisted of approximately 8,128 individuals working at our parent company and consolidated subsidiaries. We selected October1, 2017, which is within the last three months of 2017, as the date upon which we would identify the 147median employee148 to allow sufficient time to identify the median employee given the global scope of our operations. Of our 8,128 employees, 7,383 are U.S. employees and 745 are non-U.S. employees, and for purposes of applying the de minimis exemption, we had 7,383 U.S. employees and 554 non-U.S. employees. Under the de minimis exemption, we have excluded the following number of employees from each of the following jurisdictions: 190 employees from the United Kingdom and one employee from Korea, which represent in the aggregate less than 5% of our total employees who are non-U.S. employees. No more than 5% of our employees are located in any of the foregoing non-U.S. jurisdictions. We identified a consistently applied compensation measure, which would provide a picture of the annual compensation of our employees. For our consistently applied compensation measure, we used total cash compensation151a combination of salary/overtime (paid on an hourly, weekly, biweekly or monthly basis) plus a variety of other cash-based incentive pay (including commissions, bonuses and other types of production-based pay typical for their respective positions) received by the employees in our identified population. Given our multiple payroll systems and diverse global workforce, we measured compensation for our employees using the 12-month period ending September30, 2017. In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of all permanent employees included in the population who were hired during the period, but who did not work for us for the entire 12 months. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments. The HGV workforce is paid in four currencies throughout the world. To identify our median employee, we applied an average local currency to U.S. dollar exchange rate using the average monthly currency exchange rate as of September30, 2017 to the cash compensation paid in foreign currency. To identify the median employee from our employee population, we ranked our employees, excluding the CEO, high to low based on our employees146 total cash compensation. Our median employee is a full-time hourly employee, with annual total compensation for the 12-month period ended December31, 2017 in the amount of $38,190, calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Summary Compensation Table. With respect to the annual total compensation of Mr.Wang, we used the amount reported in the 147Total148 column of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement. Based on this information, for 2017, our CEO146s annual total compensation was 165 times that of the annual total compensation of our median employee. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee146s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to our pay ratio, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices, and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios.

      "Pay Ratio  We identified the median employee by examining the 2017 W-2 (for U.S. employees) and T4 (for Canadian employees) taxable wages for all U.S. and Canadian employees, including our CEO, who were employed by us on December15, 2017. We included all U.S. and Canadian employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, temporary or seasonal basis. As of December15, 2017 the Company employed 3,447 such persons. As permitted by the SEC rules, we excluded our 45 employees located in Europe and Asia since those employees comprise less than 5% of our 3,492 worldwide employees. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to the W-2 or T4 wages, and we did not annualize the compensation for any employees that were not employed by us for all of 2017. We believe the use of W-2 or T4 wages, as applicable, is the most appropriate compensation measure since it includes the total taxable compensation received by our employees in 2017.    62HollyFrontier Corporation Table of Contents After identifying the median employee based on total cash and equity compensation, we calculated annual 2017 compensation for the median employee using the same methodology used to calculate the chief executive officer146s total compensation as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table above.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, promulgated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, we determined the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Toms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, relative to the annual total compensation of our median employee. To identify the median compensated employee, we used 2017 W-2 wages for U.S. employees or its equivalent for non-US employees, excluding approximately 326 employees of Shenandoah Furniture, the business acquired by the Company on September 29, 2017. While two employees were initially identified as the median employee, the Company selected a single employee as the median employee, as required by SEC rules, choosing the employee whose income types most closely resembled that of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We then determined total compensation for the median employee in the same manner as the 8220Total Compensation8221 column shown for Mr. Toms in the Summary Compensation Table on page 30. Pay elements that were included to determine total annual compensation for the median employee were: 183 Base salary, including overtime, vacation and holiday pay 183 Annual cash incentive and 183 401(k) matching contribution We determined that the 2017 annual total compensation of the median employee was $39,698. Mr. Toms8217 2017 annual total compensation was $1,563,644 and the ratio of these amounts was 1-to-39.160160 As of December 31, 2017, our total population consisted of 1,183 employees, of which 927 were in the United States and 256 were in Asia. We believe this pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the Pay Ratio Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules under SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above.

      "Pay Ratio As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation of our median employee to the annual total compensation of Mark S. Hoplamazian, our President and Chief Executive Officer (our 147CEO148). We consider the pay ratio specified below to be a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with the requirements Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. For 2017, our last completed fiscal year:  149  the annual total compensation of the employee who represents our median compensated employee (other than our CEO) was $33,121 and  149  the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included above in the CDampA section of this proxy statement, was $9,872,656. Based on this information, for 2017, the annual total compensation of our CEO was approximately 298 times the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than the CEO). Determining the Median Employee Employee Population We used our employee population data as of October1, 2017 as the reference date for identifying our median employee. As of such date, our employee population consisted of approximately 45,000 individuals, with approximately 88% of these individuals located in the United States and approximately 4% of these individuals located in each of the Asia Pacific (ASPAC), Europe-Africa-Middle East/Southwest Asia (EAME/SWA), and Latin America, Caribbean and Canada regions. For purposes of the pay ratio calculation, our employee population consists of (i)in the United States, all full- and part-time employees at all owned, managed, leased and joint venture locations, offices and service centers and (ii)outside of the United States, all colleagues who serve at the leadership committee level or above at all locations, and all other full- and part-time employees at all owned and consolidated joint venture location, offices and service centers. Seasonal and temporary employees employed as of that date were also included in that sample. Methodology for Determining Our Median Employee To identify the median employee from our employee population, we used year-to-date Box 1 Form W-2 earnings (or, outside of the United States, a comparable local equivalent) as reflected in our U.S. and local payroll records. In identifying the median employee, we annualized the compensation of all full-time permanent employees who were new-hires in 2017 and we did not make any cost-of-living adjustments. Earnings of our employees outside the U.S. were converted to U.S. dollars using the applicable average October 2017 exchange rates. Compensation Measure and Annual Total Compensation of Median Employee With respect to the annual total compensation of the median employee, we calculated such employee146s compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. Annual Total Compensation of CEO With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the 147Total148 column of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table included above in the CDampA section of this proxy statement.  44Hyatt Hotels Corporation0052018 Proxy Statement Table of Contents ARTICLE IV: INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Proposal2 151 Ratification of Appointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  The audit committee of the board of directors has appointed Deloitteamp Touche LLP (147DampT148) as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December31, 2018.

      "Pay Ratio In accordance with Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, set forth below is information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of Mr. Coates, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and the annual total compensation of our employees. For the 2017 calendar year: The annual total compensation of Mr. Coates, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table was $1.00 and The median total compensation of our employees (other than Mr. Coates) was $85,604. Based on this information, for 2017 the ration of the annual total compensation of Mr. Coates to the median of the annual compensation of the 1,138 employees supporting the Company as of December 31, 2017 was approximately 1 to 85,604 as Mr. Coates has voluntarily elected not to accept any salary, bonus or equity incentive compensation (other than a base salary of $1.00 per year). To identify the median of the annual total compensation of our employees, the following steps were taken:  x2022 It was determined that, as of December 31, 2017, the applicable employee populations consisted of 1,138. This population consisted of all of our full-time and part-time employees. We did not engage any independent contractors in 2017 that are required to be included in our employee population for the CEO pay ratio evaluation.  x2022 To identify our 8220median employee8221 from our employee population we compared the total earnings of our employees as reflected in our payroll records as reported on Form W-2 and applied this compensation measure consistently to all of our employees required to be included in the calculation. We did not make any cost of living adjustments in identifying the 8220median employee.8221  x2022 Once we identified our median employee, we combined all elements of the employee8217s compensation for 2017 resulting in an annual compensation of $85,604. The difference between such employee8217s total earnings and the employee8217s total compensation represents the estimated value of the employee8217s health care benefits (estimated for the employee and such employee8217s eligible dependents at $13,260 and the employee8217s 401(k) matching contribution and profit sharing contribution (estimated at $1,000 per employee).  x2022 With respect to Mr. Coates, we used the amount reported in the 8220Total8221 column of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table. RISK ANALYSIS OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAMS The Compensation Committee has reviewed our compensation programs and policies as generally applicable to our employees and believes that our policies do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk-taking, and that the level of risk that they do encourage is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The design of our compensation policies and programs encourage our employees to remain focused on both the short-and long-term goals of the Company. For example, while our cash bonus plans measure performance on an annual basis, our equity awards typically vest over a number of years, which we believe encourages our employees to focus on sustained stock price appreciation, thus limiting the potential value of excessive risk- taking. The Compensation Committee believes that the balance of long-term equity incentive, short-term cash incentive bonus and base salary appropriately balances both the short and long term performance goals of the Company without encouraging excessive risk related behavior. While the Compensation Committee regularly evaluates our compensation programs, the Compensation Committee believes that its current balance of incentives both adequately compensates our employees and does not promote excessive risk taking. 39 Director Compensation Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy We believe it is essential for our long-term success to attract highly talented candidates to serve on our Board of Directors. Commensurate with this philosophy, the Board compensates its non-employee directors primarily with long-term equity- based compensation and also provides each with a cash fee on a quarterly basis. In June 2015, our Board of Directors adopted a non-employee director compensation policy, pursuant to which our non-employee directors are eligible to receive compensation for service on our Board of Directors and committees of our Board. Cash Compensation Pursuant to our non-employee director compensation policy, each non-employee director receives an annual cash retainer of $30,000 for serving on our Board of Directors. The chairperson and members of the three standing committees of our Board of Directors receive the following additional annual cash retainers:  Committee  Chairperson160Fee   Member Fee  Audit Committee  $20,000   $7,500  Compensation C\n"

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure As is permitted under the SEC rules, to determine our estimated medianemployee, we chose to use an employee population as of October1, 2017.We chose not to use the SEC Summary Compensation table definition for our calculation but instead chose to use full year actual 2017 base pay earnings, bonus, commission and overtime.We annualized pay for those who were hired in 2017. We excluded non-US population that accounts for 5% or less of Integra146s total U.S. and non-U.S. employee population. Specifically, we excluded all employees in Mexico (approximately 163 employees). By excluding these employees, we reduced the total number of our US and non-US employees considered in determining the median employee from 4,088 to 3,925. We selected an employee from that group and determined that person146s Summary Compensation table total compensation was $57,786. The ratio of CEO pay to median worker pay is 123:1. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee146s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies in our peer group may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as these other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION The Board of Directors believes that providing competitive compensation is necessary to attract and retain qualified non-employee directors. The key components of non-employee director compensation include an annual equity grant and an annual retainer. Compensation. The compensation of directors during 2017 included the compensation payable during the period beginning with the Company146s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May24, 2016 and ending with the Company146s 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May23, 2017. As compensation for their service during the period beginning with the Company146s 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, non-employee directors received an annual equity grant in the form of restricted stock with a fair market value on the date of grant of $170,000 (or $220,000 for the Chairman). Directors also received an annual retainer of $75,000, payable in one of three ways, at their election: (1)in cash, (2)in restricted stock, or (3)one half in cash and one half in restricted stock. In addition, the Company paid the following separate annual cash fees to certain directors as follows: (1) $15,000 for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair, (2) $15,000 for the Compensation Committee Chair, (3) $15,000 for the Audit Committee Chair, (4) $15,000 for the Finance Committee Chair, (5) $25,000 for the Presiding Director and (6) $75,000 for the Chairman. Effective as of the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, non-employee directors will receive an annual equity grant in the form of restricted stock with a fair market value on the date of grant of $190,000 (increased  65 Table of Contents from $170,000) (or $220,000 for the Chairman). Directors will also continue to receive an annual retainer of $75,000, payable in one of three ways, at their election: (1)in cash, (2)in restricted stock, or (3)one half in cash and one half in restricted stock.

      "Pay Ratio We believe our executive compensation program must be consistent and internally equitable to motivate our employees to perform. The Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay of our executive officers and the pay of our non-executive employees. The Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of our Chief Executive Officer146s annual total compensation in fiscal year 2017 to that of the median of all other employees for that same period. Our Chief Executive Officer146s total 2017 compensation, as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table above, was approximately $2,278,562, and our median employee146s total 2017 compensation was approximately $192,474, making our Chief Executive Officer146s pay in 2017 approximately 12 times the pay of our median employee. The pay ratio described above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (147Item 402(u)148). The median employee was identified by determining the compensation for each employee using the following consistently applied compensation measures:   149  Salary received in fiscal year 2017 (annualized if employee worked only a portion of the year)   149  Annual incentive bonus (i.e. STIP award) paid in fiscal year 2017   149  Grant date fair value of equity awards (or long-term cash compensation award) granted during fiscal year 2017   149  Auto allowance paid in fiscal year 2017 (applicable only for our employees in the U.K.) and   149  Other cash incentive awards, including inventor awards, spot bonus awards, relocation compensation, stipends, sign-on bonuses, etc. paid in fiscal year 2017. Our calculation includes all employees in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom as of December15, 2017. Our employees located in Belgium and South Korea, an aggregate total of five employees, which is less than 5% of the total number of employees, were excluded from the calculation under the de minimis exception provided for in Item 402(u). We applied Canadian and U.S. exchange rates to the compensation elements paid in Canadian dollars and U.K and U.S. exchange rates to the compensation elements paid in British pounds.   66  Table of Contents EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION The following table summarizes the company146s equity compensation plan information relating to the common stock authorized for issuance under the company146s equity compensation plans as of December31, 2017:  Plan Category  (a)NumberofSecuritiestobeIssued Upon Exercise ofOutstanding Options,Warrants and Rights(1)   (b)Weighted-AverageExercise Price ofOutstandingOptions,Warrants and Rights   (c)NumberofSecuritiesRemainingAvailableforFuture Issuance UnderEquityCompensationPlans(excluding securitiesreflected in column(a))(2)  Equity compensation plans approved by InterDigital shareholders   1,529,867   $39.55    2,403,445  Equity compensation plans not approved by InterDigital shareholders(3)   151   $151    151  Total   1,529,867   $39.55    2,403,445   (1) Column (a)includes 336,576 shares of common stock underlying outstanding time-based RSU awards and 660,398 shares of common stock underlying outstanding performance-based RSU awards, assuming a maximum payout of 200% of the target number of performance-based awards after the end of the applicable performance period, in each case including dividend equivalents credited.

      "Pay Ratio As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item402(u) of RegulationS-K, the Company is providing the following information regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation of its median employee to the annual total compensation of Mark O. Decker, Jr., the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer (the \"CEO\"). The Company considers the pay ratio specified below to be a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with the requirements in Item402(u) of RegulationS-K. For the fiscal year ended April30, 2018: 149 the annual total compensation of the employee who represents the Company's median compensated employee (other than the CEO) was $43,228 and 149 the annual total compensation of the CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table above, was $1,674,860. Based on this information, for the fiscal year ended April30, 2018, the annual total compensation of our CEO was 39 times the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than the CEO). Determining the Median Employee Employee Population The Company used its employee population data as of April30, 2018, as the reference date for identifying its median employee. As of such date, the employee population consisted of approximately 527 individuals, approximately 76.5% of whom were hourly employees, and all of whom were located in the United States. For purposes of the pay ratio calculation, the Company's employee population consists of all full-time and part-time employees at all locations, including all temporary employees employed as of the measurement date. Approximately 10.5% of the Company's employee population consisted of part-time employees as of the reference date. Methodology for Determining Our Median Employee To identify the median employee from the employee population, the Company used actual wages and benefits paid, according to its U.S. and local payroll records, in the fiscal year ended April30, 2018. In identifying the median employee, the Company annualized the compensation of all employees who were new-hires in the fiscal year ended April30, 2018, and did not make any cost-of-living adjustments. Compensation Measure and Annual Total Compensation of Median Employee With respect to the annual total compensation of the median employee, the Company calculated such employee's compensation for the fiscal year ended April30, 2018, in accordance with the requirements of Item402(c)(2)(x) of RegulationS-K. Annual Total Compensation of CEO With respect to the annual total compensation of the CEO, the Company used the amount reported in the \"Total\" column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. 56 Table of Contents Compensation Policies and Risk Management The Compensation Committee members evaluate the principal elements of executive and non-executive compensation to determine whether they encourage excessive risk-taking. While the Compensation Committee members focus on the compensation of the executive officers because risk-related decisions depend predominantly on their judgment, they also consider the compensation of other senior officers and employees operating in decision-making capacities. The Compensation Committee believes that because of the following there is a low likelihood that the Company's compensation policies and practices would encourage excessive risk-taking: 149 Compensation for certain executive officers is composed of various components: base salary, short-term incentive cash awards, and long-term incentive equity awards. The mix is designed to balance near-term performance improvement with sustainable long-term value creation. 149 A significant percentage of compensation is equity-based, long-term compensation pursuant to LTIP awards. The use of restricted shares encourages the Company's executive officers to focus on sustaining the Company's long-term performance because unvested awards could significantly decrease in value if the Company's business is not managed with long-term interests in mind. 149 The STIP and LTIP awards granted in fiscal year 2018 utilize various performance goals. The STIP awards utilize the objective performance goals of Q4FFO Run Rate per share/unit and Same Store NOI Growth as well as subjective performance goals for progress on execution of strategic plan and meeting individual personal goals. The performance-based LTIP awards utilize the Company's TSR over a three-year period as compared to the TSRs of the constituent members of the MSCI U.S. REIT Index over the same period as well as the Company's leverage ratio under the Company's line of credit.

      "Pay Ratio In August 2015, the SEC issued final rules implementing the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that requires U.S. publicly-traded companies to disclose the ratio of their Chief Executive Officer146s compensation to that of their median employee. This disclosure is required in this proxy statement and requires that the median employee be selected from all employees, including full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees.   44 Table of Contents Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio permit companies to use various methodologies and assumptions, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable with the pay ratio that we have reported. Our Chief Executive Officer to median employee pay ratio was calculated in accordance with Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and represents a reasonable estimate calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and guidance. We identified our median employee by using 2017 base salaries, our consistently applied compensation measure, for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on December1, 2017 (annualized in the case of full- and part-time employees who joined the Company during 2017). IQVIA is a global company that employs over 55,000 people with more than 70% of our workforce located outside of the U.S. Because of our vast global employee population, we applied the allowed de minimis exemption and excluded non-U.S. employees from certain countries noted below. The total number of excluded employees represented less than 5% of our population. Applying this de minimis exemption, on December1, 2017, we had 14,684 U.S. employees and 38,893 non-U.S. employees. Irrespective of the de minimis exemption, on this same date we had 14,684 U.S. employees and 41,661 non-U.S. employees. The pay ratio, as calculated according to the regulations and determined based on the 2017 total compensation reported for our Chief Executive Officer as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table, contains the following two components which may not represent his annual compensation:   150 A special retention equity award that vests over four years. The total grant date value of $19.9million in its entirety is included in our Chief Executive Officer146s compensation used for purposes of determining the 2017 ratio and   150 The performance share award granted to our Chief Executive Officer in 2017 was granted in the form of restricted stock for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code and is reported in the Summary Compensation Table at the maximum opportunity (this award has a value in the Summary Compensation Table of $6.5 million). The value of this award at target is $3.2million. For 2017, the annual total compensation of our median employee was $97,997. The annual total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer in 2017 reported in the Summary Compensation Table above included a special retention equity award and a performance award at the maximum opportunity and was $38.0million. On this basis, the ratio of our Chief Executive Officer146s annual total compensation to our median employee146s annual total compensation would be estimated at 388:1. When including total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer using the target equity award value for the performance shares granted to him in 2017 and without his special retention equity award, our Chief Executive Officer to median employee pay ratio would be estimated at 151:1. Additionally, our Company is uniquely diverse geographically, having a presence in over 100 countries with material differences in elements of pay. When calculating our pay ratio using only our U.S. population, our Chief Executive Officer to U.S. median employee pay ratio would be estimated at 364:1 and excluding the special retention equity award and valuing his 2017 performance share award at target, as described above, would be estimated at 142:1.

      "Pay RatioFor the 2017 fiscal year, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Sugarman, our chief executive officer (8220CEO Compensation8221), to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees other than our chief executive officer (8220Median Annual Compensation8221) was 33 to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions summarized below. In this summary, we refer to the employee who received such Median Annual Compensation as the 8220Median Employee.8221 For purposes of this disclosure, the date used to identify the Median Employee was December 31, 2017 (the 8220Determination Date8221).CEO Compensation for purposes of this disclosure represents the total compensation reported for Mr. Sugarman under 8220Summary Compensation Table8221 for the 2017 fiscal year. For purposes of this disclosure, Median Annual Compensation was $170,779, and was calculated by totaling for our Median Employee all applicable elements of compensation for the 2017 fiscal year in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.To identify the Median Employee, we first determined our employee population as of the Determination Date. We had 184 employees, representing all of our full-time and part-time employees, including our consolidated subsidiaries, as of the Determination Date. This number does not include any independent contractors or 8220leased8221 workers, in accordance with applicable SEC rules. We then measured compensation for the period beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2017 for these employees. This compensation measurement was calculated by totaling, for each employee, gross taxable earnings, including salary, bonuses and the value of stock awards granted during 2017. A portion of our employee workforce (full-time and part-time) worked for less than the full fiscal year due to commencing employment after the beginning of the fiscal year. In determining the Median Employee, we annualized the compensation for such individuals.32Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider ParticipationAs of the date of this proxy statement, the members of the Compensation Committee are Robert160W. Holman, Jr. (Chair), Robin Josephs and Barry W. Ridings. No member of the Compensation Committee is or was formerly an officer or an employee of the company. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of the our board, nor has such interlocking relationship existed in the past.Section16016(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting ComplianceSection16016(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and other of our equity securities. Directors, officers and greater than 10% shareholders are required to furnish us with copies of all Section16016(a) forms they file. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us, during the fiscal year ended December16031, 2017, all Section16016(a) filing requirements applicable to our directors, officers and greater than 10% beneficial owners were met.DIRECTOR COMPENSATIONOur compensation program for our non8209employee directors provides for payments of annual retainers for directors, committee chairs and committee members and annual equity awards for directors. Directors do not receive additional fees for board or committee meetings attended. Currently, we pay all non8209employee directors an annual retainer of $100,000, paid in quarterly cash installments. The chairs of our board committees receive the following annual retainers, paid in quarterly cash installments: Audit Committee-$40,000 Compensation Committee-$40,000 and other committees-$16,000. Committee members receive the following annual retainers, paid in quarterly cash installments: Audit Committee-$15,000 Compensation Committee-$15,000 and other committees-$10,000. Each non8209employee director receives an annual equity award of $125,000, payable at their election in common stock equivalents (CSEs) or restricted shares of our common stock. The number of CSEs or restricted shares is based on the average NYSE closing price for our common stock for the 20160days prior to the date of the annual shareholders meeting. Our Lead Director receives an additional award of $75,000, in consideration of her services as Lead Director, payable at her election in CSEs or restricted shares based on the average NYSE closing price for our common stock for the 20160days prior to the date of the annual shareholders meeting.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE We provide fair and equitable compensation to our employees through a combination of competitive base160pay, incentives, retirement plans, and other benefits. We are disclosing the following160pay ratio160and supporting information, which compares the annual total compensation of our160median employee160and the annual total compensation of Mr.160Jackson, our CEO, as required by Section160953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The160pay ratio160is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item160402(u) of Regulation S-K. The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee8217s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported below, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. To determine the160pay ratio, we took the following steps: 183 We determined that as of December16031, 2017 (the 8220Determination Date8221), our employee population consisted of approximately 24,222 individuals, all located in the United States (the 8220Employee Population8221). We selected the Determination Date because it was a recent date for which employee census information is readily available. The Employee Population consists of our full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees. 183 In accordance with the \"de minimis\" exemption provided in Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we excluded from the Employee Population all 1,178 of our non-U.S. employees (one employee in Canada and 1,177 employees in Mexico) working for us on December 31, 2017, representing approximately 4.6% of our total U.S. and non-U.S. workforce. We employed approximately 25,400 employees as of December 31, 2017, including U.S. and non-U.S. employees. 183 To identify the median employee, we started with the salary paid to each employee in the Employee Population during calendar year 2017. We annualized the salary for each permanent full-time and part-time employee in the Employee Population that worked less than the full year.160We then added in incentive payments, the grant date fair value of equity awards, the value of accelerated equity awards, and company matching benefits to our 401(k) plan, as applicable for each employee in the Employee Population. Once we identified our median employee, we calculated such employee8217s annual total compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item160402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in that employee8217s annual total compensation of $46,718. The median employee8217s annual total compensation includes salary, as well as incentive payments. The median employee did not receive equity awards, company matching contributions to our 401(k) plan, or health or other fringe benefits. Median employee compensation reflects that, as of December 31, 2017, approximately 5.7% of our employees were student drivers, which had the effect of lowering our median employee compensation. We had two individuals in the role of CEO during 2017. We elected to use the compensation of Mr. Jackson, the active CEO as of December 31, 2017, for purposes of determining the CEO pay ratio. Mr. Jackson became CEO on the Merger Date. In determining Mr. Jackson8217s compensation, we adjusted the compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table to reflect his compensation as if he were CEO for the full calendar year, by (i) increasing his salary and perquisites and other personal benefits as if he were CEO effective January 1, 2017 ($417,783), (ii) including the grant date fair value of a time-based equity award Mr. Jackson received for Knight prior to the 2017 Merger ($600,000), and (iii) including 401(k) contibutions and accrued dividends paid on vested RSUs prior to the 2017 Merger ($13,451). For purposes of calculating the CEO Pay Ratio, this resulted in total annual compensation of $3,527,333 for the CEO, as opposed to the amount shown in the Summary Compensation Table of $2,496,099. The 2017 Merger had the effect of raising our CEO compensation due to, among other things, accelerated vesting of certain equity awards and a special bonus in respect of the 2017 Merger. 57 Table of Contents For 2017, our last completed fiscal year: 183 The annual total compensation of our160median employee160was $46,718 and 183 The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement, was $2,496,099.

      "Pay Ratio   As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Matthew J. Simoncini, our President and CEO in 2017. For 2017, our last completed fiscal year:  149  The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than our CEO) was $10,216 and  149  The annual total compensation of our CEO was $14,833,466. Based on this information, for 2017, our CEO146s annual total compensation was 1,452 times that of the annual total compensation of the median employee (as determined below). This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in good faith, in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. The Securities and Exchange Commission (147SEC148) rules for identifying the 147median employee148 and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee146s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio set forth above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the 147median employee,148 the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments and estimates that we used were as follows:  1. We determined that, as of October1, 2017, our employee population consisted of approximately 158,971 individuals working at the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, with approximately 9,171 of these individuals located in the United States and approximately 149,800 of these individuals located outside of the United States.  2. We employed a proportionate stratified statistical sampling methodology to help simplify the identification of the median employee. The sample size used was approximately 1,590 employees.  3. We utilized 2017 base pay as our consistently applied compensation measure to identify the median employee from our employee population, which we applied to all employees included in our analysis. We did not make any cost of living adjustments in identifying the median employee. Using this methodology, we determined that the median employee was an hourly employee located outside of the United States.  4. With respect to the annual total compensation of the median employee, we identified and calculated the elements of such employee146s compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $10,216.  5. With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the 147Total148 column (column (j)) of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference under Item 11 of Part III of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   2018ProxyStatement   |   55  Table of Contents  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION The following persons served on our Compensation Committee during all or a portion of 2017: Dr.Jepsen, Ms.Ligocki and Messrs.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure In August 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the Company146s median employee146s total annual compensation to the total annual compensation of the Company146s principal executive officer (147PEO148). The Company146s PEO is Mr.David Rogers, our Chief Executive Officer. To determine the median employee, we reviewed a list of all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries as of December31, 2017 and examined total cash compensation paid to each such employee during 2017 including cash paid for employer 401(k) match and cash paid by the Company for health insurance premiums as is consistent with the calculation of compensation for the Named Executive Officers of the Company above. Cash compensation was annualized for those employees as of December31, 2017 who were not employed for the full year. We believe that the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely grant equity awards to employees. After identifying the median employee using total cash compensation, we calculated the annual total compensation of such employee using the same methodology we use for our Named Executive Officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for 2017 included in this proxy statement. The ratio of annual total compensation of the Company146s PEO to the median annual total compensation of all Company employees (excluding the PEO) is as follows:    Median employee146s annual total compensation  $30,288   Annual total compensation of Mr.David Rogers, our PEO  $2,704,207 Ratio of Mr.David Rogers146 annual total compensation to the median employee146s annual total compensation  89to1 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation No member of the Compensation Committee is or has been an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. In addition, no member of the Compensation Committee had any relationships with the Company or any other entity that require disclosure under the proxy rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee evaluates and establishes compensation for Named Executive Officers and oversees the Company146s stock plans, and other management incentive, benefit and perquisite programs. Management has the primary responsibility for the Company146s financial statements and reporting process, including the disclosure of executive compensation. With this in mind, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with management the disclosure appearing under the heading 147Compensation Discussion and Analysis148 of this Proxy Statement. The Compensation Committee is satisfied that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis fairly and completely represents the philosophy, intent, and actions of the Company with regard to executive   Life Storage, Inc. 2018 Proxy Statement  - 56 - compensation.

      "Pay RatioFor fiscal year 2018:9642the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than our Chief Executive Officer) was $9,592 and9642the annual total compensation of Mr. Bracken Darrell, our President and Chief Executive Officer was $7,239,855.Based on this information, for fiscal year 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Darrell to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 75532to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As permitted by SEC rules, to identify our median employee, we selected base pay, which we calculated as annual base pay using a reasonable estimate of the hours worked during fiscal year 201832for hourly employees and using annual salary levels for our remaining employees, as the compensation measure to be used to compare the compensation of our employees as of January 31, 2018 for the ten-month period from April 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018. We annualized base pay for any permanent employees who commenced work during fiscal year 2018. We did not include any contractors or other non-employee workers in our employee population.Using this approach, we selected the individual at the median of our employee population, who was a manufacturing employee based in China. We then calculated annual total compensation for this individual using the same methodology we use for our Named Executive Officers as set forth in our \"Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018\". We determined that such individual8217s annual total compensation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was $9,59232(excluding any estimated retirement and health benefits).During fiscal year 2018, Mr. Darrell served as our President and Chief Executive Officer. We determined Mr. Darrell8217s annual total compensation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was $7,239,855, as reported in our \"Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018\". 16082Compensation of Non-Employee DirectorsFor fiscal year 2018, the compensation of the members of the Board of Directors that are not Logitech employees, or non-employee directors, was determined by the Compensation Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, and recommended to the full Board for approval.The general policy is that compensation for non-employee directors should consist of a mix of cash and equity-based compensation. For fiscal year 2018, to assist the Compensation Committee in its annual review of director compensation, Compensia provided a written analysis of director pay practices and compensation data compiled from the annual reports and proxy statements of companies within our compensation peer group.For fiscal year 2018, cash compensation of non-employee directors consists solely of annual retainers based on Board and committee service and payment for travel days in connection with attendance at Board meetings. While we historically paid for travel days in connection with Board meetings, we discontinued this component of our board compensation program effective with our 2017 to 2018 Board Year, which began in the middle of fiscal year 2018. Non-employee directors also receive an annual RSU grant based on a fixed market value. During fiscal year 2018, these annual RSU grants were made on the day of our Annual General Meeting with a one-year vesting period. Directors who are Logitech employees do not receive any compensation for their service on the Board of Directors. Non-employee director compensation for the 2017 to 2018 Board Year consists of the following elements:160Amount (CHF)160Amount ($)(1)Annual cash retainer60,00016061,806An additional annual cash retainer for the lead independent director20,00016020,602Annual retainer for the Audit Committee chair40,00016041,204Annual retainer for the Compensation Committee chair40,00016041,204Annual retainer for the Nominating Committee chair11,00016011,331Annual retainer for non-chair Audit Committee members20,00016020,602Annual retainer for non-chair Compensation Committee members15,00016015,452Annual retainer for non-chair Nominating Committee members5,0001605,151Annual RSU grant165,000160169,967Reimbursement of reasonable expenses for non-local travel (business class)160160160(1)Amounts in Swiss Francs were converted using the 12-month average (April 201732to March 2018) exchange rate of 1 Swiss Franc to 1.030132U.S. Dollars.Non-employee Board members may elect to receive their Board fees in shares, net of withholdings at the market price on the date of the Annual General Meeting.

      "Pay Ratio For the 2017 fiscal year, the ratio of the annual total compensation of W. Bradley Southern, our CEO (147CEO Compensation148), to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees and those of our consolidated subsidiaries other than our CEO (147Median Annual Compensation148) was 65 to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions summarized below. In this summary, we refer to the employee who received such Median Annual Compensation as the 147Median Employee.148 For purposes of this disclosure, the date used to identify the Median Employee was October1, 2017 (the 147Determination Date148). As discussed in the Compensation and Analysis, both Mr.Southern and Mr.Stevens served as our Chief Executive Officer during 2017. CEO Compensation for purposes of this disclosure represents the total compensation reported for Mr.Southern under 1472017 Summary Compensation Table148 for 2017, plus personal benefits and compensation under benefit plans annualized based on Mr.Southern146s period of service during 2017 and reasonable estimates regarding the composition of Mr.Southern146s compensation that would have been applicable if Mr.Southern would have been CEO for the entire 2017. For purposes of this disclosure, Median Annual Compensation was $63,566, and was calculated by totaling for our Median Employee all applicable elements of compensation for 2017 in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K plus personal benefits and compensation under benefit plans otherwise not reportable under this Item. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the Median Employee. To identify the Median Employee, we first determined our employee population as of the Determination Date. We had 4,639 employees (other than the CEO), representing all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees of us and our consolidated subsidiaries as of the Determination Date. This number does not include any independent contractors or 147leased148 workers, as permitted by the applicable SEC rules. Of our 4,639 total employees, approximately 496 (or 11%) are employed in Chile and approximately 215 (less than 5%) are employed in Brazil. We have chosen to exclude all 215 Brazilian employees in determining our Median Employee, as permitted under the de minimis exemption to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We used our number of total employees (4,639) in making our de minimis calculation. We then measured compensation for the period beginning on January1, 2017 and ending on September30, 2017 for 4,424 employees (after the permitted exclusions noted above). This compensation measurement was calculated by totaling, for each employee, salary as shown in our payroll records for the first nine months. A portion of our employee workforce (full-time and part-time) worked for less than the full fiscal year due to commencing employment after the beginning of the fiscal year. In determining the Median Employee, we did not annualize the total compensation for such individuals.  44 Table of Contents DIRECTORS146 COMPENSATION The following table summarizes compensation paid to outside directors for services during 2017.

      "Pay RatioSummaryAs a result of the recently adopted rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we have begun disclosing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our principal executive officer to that of our median employee.Mr. Potdevin, our former chief executive officer, had a total annual compensation of $5,089,999 in fiscal 2017, as reflected in the above summary compensation table. Our estimated median employee's annualized total compensation was $22,218. Mr. Potdevin's total compensation was approximately3222932times that of our median employee in fiscal 2017. We anticipate the CEO pay ratio will fluctuate over the next few years as we onboard a new Chief Executive Officer. Our Median EmployeeAs illustrated in the table below, the estimated median employee of lululemon for fiscal 201732was an Educator, our name for our store associates, that worked on a part-time hourly basis during the fiscal year.

Annualized earnings include salary earned, bonus earned, and actual equity granted value. This does not apply to seasonal or temporary employees.Employee Workforce Definition160Generally, employees who worked any portion of the fiscal year and who are active earners (for example, not on leave) are included. The countries included in the analysis are Australia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.De-Minimus Rule160Employee groups in certain non-U.S. countries have been excluded as the aggregate total of these employees amounts less than 5% of our total employee workforce. The countries excluded are France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, and Switzerland. The total number of employees excluded from the analysis is approximately 500 based on a total workforce of approximately 13,400.Exchange Rates160All figures shown are in U.S. dollars.

      "pay ratio disclosure is located after the section in this proxy statement entitled \"Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.\"Tally SheetsIn addition to the market analysis, our compensation committee reviewed internal tally sheets for each executive officer. These tally sheets are designed to show the total compensation awarded and realized, which includes what has been paid to each executive officer as well as what would be paid to the executive officer following termination of his or her employment under various scenarios. Our compensation committee believes these tally sheets provide a comprehensive picture of an executive's total compensation along with providing the committee with a better understanding of how each component of a compensation package fits together. These tally sheets also assist the committee in evaluating the appropriate amount of each NEO's compensation based on the wealth accumulation of each NEO. 182017 Base SalaryBase salary is a major part of compensation for all of our employees. However, it becomes a smaller percentage of total compensation as an employee rises through the ranks. Base salary is important to provide individual financial stability for personal planning purposes. There are also motivational and reward aspects to base salary, as base salary can be increased or decreased to account for considerations such as individual performance and time in the position. The position benchmarking we perform considers peer market data from the executive compensation peer group and third-party survey data. Base salary for each NEO is determined by evaluating the base salary of each NEO compared to data from our executive compensation peer group when available and external third-party survey information, along with our CEO's recommendations for NEO's other than himself. In evaluating 2017 base salaries for our NEOs, our compensation committee determined base salaries for our NEOs were significantly lower than the market data. Therefore, base salaries of our NEOs were increased to become closer aligned to the 50th percentile of market data.

Selvidge160$340,0001601.04Long-Term Equity Incentive CompensationOur compensation committee believes it is important to allocate a significant percentage of the total compensation of each NEO to long-term performance and risks similar to those experienced by our unitholders. Our compensation committee accomplishes this objective by structuring a larger percentage of our NEO's compensation in the form of long-term variable incentive compensation rather than in the form of base salary. Our compensation committee further believes properly structured long-term performance-based compensation will encourage long-term management strategies that will benefit our unitholders. Our LTIP has been designed to: (i)160aid in the retention of key employees, including our NEOs, who are important to the success of our Partnership (ii)160motivate employee contributions toward long-term growth through ownership in our Partnership and (iii)160align potential increases in compensation to long-term increases in unitholder value. Using the equity compensation philosophy described above, as well as the information gathered from the market analysis, it has been the practice of our compensation committee to grant phantom units to our NEOs during the first quarter of each year. Beginning in 2015, our compensation committee decided our long-term incentive awards should consist of both time-based and performance-based unit awards. Our compensation committee believes combining these two forms of awards, with a heavier weighting on the performance element, is an effective way to focus attention on unitholder return and helps us retain our executive talent in a competitive market. Time-based and performance-based unit awards are subject to forfeiture if employment is terminated for any reason other than for retirement, death or disability prior to the end of the vesting or performance period. In the event of a grantee's termination due to death, disability or retirement, the number of time-based and performance-based units awarded will be prorated based upon the completed months of employment during the vesting period, and the award will be paid following the end of the vesting period with the performance-based units payout based upon the actual achievement of the performance goals. The awards do not have an early, or accelerated, vesting feature except when there is a change-in-control combined with an associated actual or constructive termination. The change-in-control provisions of our LTIP are discussed in the section below entitled \"Termination, Sever\n"

      "PAY RATIO As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the median annual total compensation of all of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Pedersen, who served as our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer until January 1, 2018, at which time he became our Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board. For fiscal 2017, the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than Mr. Pedersen) was $87,306, and the annual total compensation of Mr. Pedersen, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included elsewhere in this proxy statement, was $4,401,206. Based on this information, for fiscal 2017, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Pedersen to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than Mr. Pedersen) was 50 to1. The ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Pedersen to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than Mr. Pedersen) presented above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. This ratio is not comparable to the ratio reported by other public companies, because each company uses its own assumptions, methodologies and estimates when computing the ratio. To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and Mr. Pedersen, we took the following steps:  8226 We determined that, as of October 1, 2017, our employee population consisted of approximately 7,080 individuals. This population consisted of our full-time, part-time, and temporary employees, and does not include any independent contractors that we have engaged.  8226 To identify the median employee from our employee population, we compared the total amount of compensation paid in 2017 to our active employees as of October 1, 2017, as reflected in our payroll records. We identified our median employee using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all employees included in the calculation.  8226 Once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee8217s compensation for fiscal 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $87,306.  8226 For the annual total compensation of Mr. Pedersen, we used the amount reported in the 8220Total8221 column (column (i)) of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. This information is being provided for compliance purposes. Neither the Compensation Committee nor management of the Company used the pay ratio measure in making compensation decisions.   39 160160160ManTech 2018 Proxy Statement   AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT The Audit Committee reviews ManTech8217s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal financial controls, for preparing the financial statements, and for the public reporting process.

      "Pay Ratio We believe our executive compensation program must be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our employees to create shareholder value. We monitor the relationship between the compensation of our executive officers and the compensation of our non-managerial employees. For 2017, the total compensation of Joe Hanna, our President and Chief Executive Officer of $1,607,711, as shown in the 147Summary Compensation Table148 above (the 147CEO Compensation148), was approximately 30times the total cash compensation of a median employee calculated in the same manner of $54,515.  37 Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with the SEC146s rules pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December31, 2017, the last day of our payroll year. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments or estimates with respect to total cash compensation, and we did not annualize the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2017. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees. 2017 GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS       Estimated FuturePayouts UnderNon-EquityIncentive PlanAwards(1)   Estimated Future PayoutsUnderEquity IncentivePlan Awards(2)   AllOtherStockAwards:NumberofSharesof Stockor Units()  All OtherOptionAwards:Number ofSecuritiesUnderlyingOptions()(3)   Exerciseor BasePrice ofOptionAwards($/Sh)   GrantDateFairValue ofStockandOptionAwards  Name  GrantDate   Threshold($)   Target($)   Maximum($)   Threshold()   Target()   Maximum()             Joseph F.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE  Pursuant to SEC rules, to determine our median employee, we used W-2 compensation for our entire employee population, all of whom are located within the United States. As of December 31, 2017, we identified our median employee (excluding our CEO from the calculation). For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we calculated the median employeersquos total compensation using the same methodology that we used to calculate the total compensation for our CEO. The 2017 annual total compensation of the median employee and our CEO, respectively, were $80,186 and $9,595,458. The ratio of the 2017 annual total compensation for our CEO to that of our median employee was 120to 1.  COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND RISK MANAGEMENT  The Company believes that its compensation policies and practices for its employees, including executive officers, do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.   COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION  The following persons served as members of the Compensation Committee during 2017: Raymond T. Baker and Herbert T. Buchwald. None of the committee members were, during the last fiscal year, officers or employees of the Company, none were formerly officers of the Company and none had a material interest in a quotrelated personquot transaction since the beginning of 2017. During 2017, none of our executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or Compensation Committee.  53 Table of Contents  PROPOSAL TWO ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended and SEC Rule 14a-21(a), we are providing our shareholders the opportunity to vote on a non-binding, advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers (say-on-pay), which is described in this Proxy Statement.  ldquoRESOLVED, that the shareholders hereby approve on an advisory basis the compensation of the Companyrsquos named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion.rdquo  We have been providing these advisory votes on an annual basis.

As described above under ldquoCompensation Discussion and Analysis,rdquo we believe that our ability to retain and motivate named executive officers with the skills, experience and capacity to succeed in our competitive industry has been essential to the success of our Company and a significant factor in creating long-term value for our shareholders.

We endeavor to deliver fair and appropriate compensation to our executive officers that is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

      "Pay RatioItem 402(u) of Regulation S-K requires us to disclose the annual total compensation of Geoffrey Cook, our Chief Executive Officer, the annual total compensation of a median employee, and their ratio to each other (the 8220CEO pay ratio8221). For our 201732fiscal year, we estimate that these amounts were as follows:Mr. Cook8217s annual total compensation - $1,880,59532160160160160Our median employee8217s annual total compensation - $115,197Ratio of Mr. Cook8217s annual total compensation to our median employee8217s annual total compensation - 16:1160160160160For purposes of this calculation, Mr. Cook8217s annual total compensation is the amount shown as 8220Total Compensation8221 in the Summary Compensation Table and the annual total compensation of our median employee was determined in the same manner as the 8220Total Compensation8221 for Mr. Cook in the Summary Compensation Table. To determine our median employee, we took into account the following compensation elements, which we determined are the most commonly used elements of compensation for our employees worldwide:8226Annualized salary as of December 31, 20178226Cash bonus earned in fiscal year 201732and paid in 20188226Grant date fair value of equity awards granted in fiscal year 2017Our calculation of the median employee included all employees, including full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal, and foreign employees, employed by us and our subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. The compensation of permanent employees who were not employed for the entire year, such as new hires, was annualized. We applied a currency exchange rate for employees not paid in U.S. dollars using a 12-month average. We determined the compensation of our median employee by: (i) calculating the annual compensation described above for each of our employees, and (ii) ranking the annual compensation of all employees except for the CEO from lowest to highest.CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSPolicies and ProceduresOn January16029, 2007, our management adopted the Related Party Transactions Policy.

      "Pay Ratio DisclosureAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of the Company8217s employees and the annual total compensation of Gabriel Tirador, President and Chief Executive Officer. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.For 2017, the Company8217s last completed fiscal year:8226the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than Mr. Tirador) was $60,006 and8226the annual total compensation of Mr. Tirador, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, was $1,368,503.Based on this information, for 2017, the ratio of the median of the total compensation of all employees of the Company to the annual total compensation of Mr. Tirador was 1 to 23. The Company determined that, as of December 31, 2017, its employee population consisted of 4,27732individuals (including Mr. Tirador). The Company8217s employee workforce consists of full and part time employees. For purposes of measuring the compensation of the Company8217s employees, it selected total annual cash compensation for 201732as the most appropriate measure of compensation, which was consistently applied to all employees included in the calculation. With respect to the total annual compensation of the 8220median employee8221 for purposes of the ratio disclosed above, the Company identified and calculated the elements of such employee8217s compensation for 201732in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in the annual total compensation reflected above.Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation in Compensation DecisionsDuring fiscal year 2017, Donald R.

Mr. Curtius previously served as an officer of the Company.PROPOSAL 2:ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATIONThe Company8217s executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain a talented team of executives. The Company seeks to accomplish this goal in a way that rewards performance that is aligned with its shareholders8217 long-term interests.

This proposal is a non-binding vote, but gives shareholders the 18opportunity to express their views on the compensation of the Company8217s named executive officers. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the named executive officers.Accordingly, the following resolution is submitted for shareholder vote at the 201832Annual Meeting:8220RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Mercury General Corporation approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of its named executive officers as disclosed in the Proxy Statement for the 201832Annual Meeting pursuant to Item160402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying tabular disclosure regarding named executive officer compensation and the corresponding narrative disclosure and footnotes.8221As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding.

We believe that annual total compensation is a consistently applied compensation measure and appropriate for determining the median-paid employee. We used actual annual total compensation (converted, where applicable, to U.S. dollars based on an average annual exchange rate for the year ended December31, 2017), and did not make any assumptions or adjustments to the amounts determined.   53 1602018 PROXY STATEMENT160 |160 www.merit.com  Table of Contents  Audit Matters  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT The Audit Committee provides oversight of our accounting and financial reporting processes, systems of internal accounting and financial controls and the audits of our financial statements.

      "PAY RATIOWe are a global luxury fashion group operating in three principal geographic markets: the Americas (including North America, Latin America and the Caribbean), Europe and Asia. We employed approximately 14,84632employees as of the end of Fiscal 2018, consisting of approximately 8,16632full-time employees and approximately 6,68032part-time employees. Approximately 12,19732of our employees are engaged in retail selling or administrative positions. Presented below is the ratio of the annual total compensation paid to John D. Idol, our Chief Executive Officer, in Fiscal 201832to the annual total compensation of our median employee, excluding Mr. Idol's compensation. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in compliance of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. MethodologyThe methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments and estimates that we used to identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the 8220median employee,8221 were as follows: 8226We selected February 1, 2018 as the date on which to determine our median employee.63160| MICHAEL KORS HOLDINGS LIMITED1602018 Proxy Statement8226We relied on the de minimis exemption provided for under the pay ratio disclosure rules which permit us to exclude non-U.S. employees constituting less than 5% of the total employee population from the median employee calculation.9702We excluded 295 employees (representing less than 2.5% of our total employee population, excluding the CEO) from eight countries as follows: 10 employees in Lithuania, 7 employees in Latvia, 13 employees in Romania, 76 employees in Poland, 19 employees in Czech Republic, 93 employees in Taiwan, 23 employees in Panama, 6 employees in Aruba, 4 employees in St. Maarten, 5 employees in Barbados, 5 employees in Costa Rica, 10 employees in Chile and 24 employees in Hungary.8226We excluded Jimmy Choo employees in accordance with the pay ratio disclosure rules.8226We analyzed the actual total earnings compiled from our payroll records for the one year period ending December 31, 2017 to determine the median employee. Actual earnings included base pay, overtime compensation, bonuses and other incentive pay (including commissions, fringe benefits and 401(k) match). 9702We annualized the compensation of the employees who were hired during the applicable period, but who did not work for the Company during the entire 12 months.9702We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments to adjust for employees living outside of New York City.9702For employees in foreign jurisdictions, we converted amounts paid in local currencies to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of February 1, 2018.Calculation8226We determined that our median employee was a part-time, hourly retail sales associate located in the United States. 8226The estimated annual total compensation for our median employee was $23,128. 8226Fiscal 201832annual total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table was $7,607,476.8226The estimated ratio of our Chief Executive Officer8217s annual total compensation to our median employee8217s total compensation for Fiscal 201832was 32932to 1. DIRECTOR COMPENSATIONDirector Compensation GenerallyNon-employee directors receive annual cash compensation comprised of an annual retainer and fees for each meeting attended, including a travel fee for intercontinental travel to our Board of Directors' meetings in the United Kingdom.

      "Pay Ratio    For 2017, the total compensation of the Companyx2019s Chief Executive Officer of $7,562,320, as presented in the Summary Compensation Table, was approximately 497times the total compensation of the Companyx2019s median employee of $15,229 calculated in the same manner. The median employee, a part-time employee, was identified by reviewing the total cash compensation for all employeesemployed by the Company as of the determination date,January 31, 2018, excluding Mr. Rubin. All of the Companyx2019s employees were included, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis. Adjustments were made to annualize the compensation of full-time employees who were not employed by the Company for the entire year. After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, the 2017 annual total compensation was calculated for the median employee using the same methodology used for the Companyx2019s Chief Executive Officer as presented in the Summary Compensation Table above.   Over 75% of our employees are part-time and / or seasonal employees in our stores or distribution centers.In comparison, the total compensation of the Companyx2019s Chief Executive Officer was approximately 183 times thetotal compensation of the Companyx2019s median full-time employee of $41,283 calculated in the same manner as the ChiefExecutive Officerx2019s total compensation.

      "PAY RATIO The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Company to determine the ratio of the CEO8217s annual total compensation (under the Summary Compensation Table definition) to that of the Company8217s median employee.In the identification of our median employee we used October 31, 2017 as our determination date.As of the determination date, the Company had 2,039 employees, excluding the CEO.For purposes of identifying the median employee we included in the calculation of compensation: base salary, stock-based compensation (based on the grant date fair value of awards granted in 2017), target bonus amounts, estimated annual commissions and estimated overtime.We ranked our full employee population from the highest paid to the lowest paid and the employee at the midpoint is our median employee. The total compensation for the median employee was then calculated in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of SEC Regulation S-K.Annual total compensation for Mr. Olsson, the Company8217s CEO was $4,632,700, which was approximately 78 times the median employee compensation of $59,092. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee8217s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may use different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios. 2017 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION Information regarding our non-employee Director compensation can be found under 82208212 Compensation of Non-Employee Directors8221 discussed previously in this Proxy Statement. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION Ms. Dial, Mr. Goble, Mr. Martell. Ms. McWaters and Mr. Trachtenberg were members of the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2017. Ms. Dial became Chairman in January 2017. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, no member of the Compensation Committee had any relationship with the Company requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, none of the Company8217s executive officers served on the compensation committee (or its equivalent) or board of directors of another entity any of whose executive officers served on the Company8217s Compensation Committee or Board. 56  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT This report of the Compensation Committee shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any previous filing by us under either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act that incorporates future Securities Act or Exchange Act filings in whole or in part by reference. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the 8220Compensation Discussion and Analysis8221 section of the 2018 Proxy Statement. Based on our review and discussions, we have recommended to the Board that the 8220Compensation Discussion and Analysis8221 be included in the 2018 Proxy Statement and in Company8217s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December16031, 2017.

Executive Summary201732Business HighlightsMosaic8217s 201732financial results reflected a challenging pricing environment for our industry. For 2017:8226Net loss attributable to Mosaic for the year ended December16031, 2017 was $(107.2) million, or $(0.31) per diluted share, compared to 2016 net earnings of $297.8 million, or $0.85 per diluted share. 2017 results include a discrete income tax expense of $451 million, or $(1.30) per diluted share, primarily related to enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.8226Operating earnings were $465.7 million, up from $319.0 million in 2016, driven by higher gross margins in both Potash and Phosphates.8226We maintained cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion, excluding restricted cash. In January 2018 we used $1.08 billion in cash to close the Acquisition and pre-paid $200 million of our outstanding term loan facility. In 2017 we continued to take steps toward achieving our strategic priorities as described under 8220Summary Information - Business Highlights,8221 beginning on page 3. We focused on cost and capital controls, as well as opportunities for growth to position Mosaic to outperform in the years ahead. For example:8226We continued our pre-closing integration planning with respect to our pending acquisition of Vale8217s global phosphate and potash operations conducted through Vale Fertilizantes S.A. Following completion of the Acquisition on January 8, 2018, we are the leading fertilizer production and distribution company in Brazil, as the Acquisition increased our finished phosphates capacity by over four million tonnes and our finished potash capacity by approximately 500,000 tonnes. 8226We had record sales volumes of 7.4 million tonnes in our International Distribution segment in 2017.31Table of Contents8226We are on track to achieve our goal of reaching $500 million in cost savings by the end of 2018 and realized the goal we set in 2016 to achieve an additional $75 million in savings in our support functions. 8226In November 2017, we completed a $1.25 billion public debt offering, consisting of $550 million aggregate principal amount of 3.250% senior notes due 2022 and $700 million aggregate principal amount of 4.050% senior notes due 2027. Proceeds from this offering were used primarily to fund the $1.08 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the Acquisition paid at closing. The remainder was used to pay transaction costs and expenses and to fund a portion of the $200 million that we pre-paid against our outstanding term loan in January 2018.8226While we continue to support key strategic projects and protect the integrity of our assets, we continued to manage our capital through the prioritization of our expenditures and the deferral, reduction or elimination of certain capital spending. Capital expenditures in 2017 were the lowest in over five years. 8226In October 2017, we announced the temporary idling of our Plant City, Florida phosphate manufacturing facility for at least one year and restructuring of our Phosphates operations. We expect that these actions will reduce market disruption from new capacity additions, including MWSPC. We also expect to see higher phosphate margins and lower capital requirements for Mosaic by reducing production at a relatively higher-cost facility.Executive Compensation HighlightsWe operate in a cyclical and seasonal industry i\n"

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure  On August 5, 2015, the SEC adopted new rules implementing the pay ratio disclosure requirement of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). These rules require reporting companies to disclose the ratio of the annual compensation of the company39s median employee to the annual compensation of its principal executive officer and became effective for us in this proxy statement for our 2018 annual meeting.  We determined our median employee based on the bi-weekly payroll ended November 19, 2017 and paid on November 28, 2017. The gross pay for all employees paid on the selected payroll, other than the CEO, were ranked highest to lowest. The annual gross compensation for the median employee selected in this analysis was $27,909, and our CEOrsquos annual compensation for 2017 was $1,107,966. The ratio of these amounts is 39.7 to one.  There is a great deal of flexibility in how the median employee is identified. Companies are using different approaches that are appropriate for their employee population and compensation programs and are using estimates and assumptions. As a result, the ratios that other companies have calculated may not be comparable to the ratio that we have presented not only because of different businesses or different compensation programs, but because of using different methodologies and assumptions.  32   DIRECTOR COMPENSATION  Our principles of directorsrsquo compensation are aligned with the overall goals and objectives of overall partner compensation. That is, the directors (as the policy makers for the Company) should be compensated primarily by the quality and financial performance of the Company and only secondarily by cash compensation. Accordingly, director compensation is divided into two components:  A.Cash Compensation. Directors receive cash compensation based on meetings attended. The current compensation is $3,000 per regularly scheduled meeting attended and is an amount which was recommended to the Board by the Chief Executive Officer, but which may be set at the Boardrsquos discretion. Since 2002, the Company also chartered and created three Board committees: the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Audit Committee. Beginning in 2008, the Chairman of the Audit Committee received an additional fee of $8,000 per year and the Chairmen of the Compensation and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees each received an additional fee of $4,000 per year. In addition, Mr. LaRoche serves on the Certification Committee as described above and he received $4,000 for serving on that committee.  B.Equity Awards. The 2010 Plan provides that directors who are not executive officers will receive a five-year stock option grant to purchase 7,500 shares of the Common Stock to be granted and issued on the day of the annual meeting of shareholders each year with an exercise price set at the closing price of NHCrsquos Common Stock on that day. Such options will expire at the end of five years and vest immediately upon grant.  For 2017, the Compensation Committee granted to each non-employee director a discretionary cash bonus of $125,000. These bonuses must be used by Board members to exercise outstanding options and thus increase their ownership in the Company. The Company believes that it helps align the directorsrsquo interest with that of the shareholders by encouraging increased stock ownership. The Board annually reviews its total compensation package in light of compensation paid to directors of comparable health care companies and has found its compensation comparable with similar companies. The Board, in its reviews of its total compensation, took the bonuses described above into account when comparing its compensation to the compensation paid to directors of comparable health care companies.  33   2017 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION  Name Fees Earned or Paid in Cash ($) Option Awards ($) (1) All Other Compensation ($) (2) Total ($) (a) (b) (d) (g) (h) J.

      "Pay RatioWe calculated the CEO Pay Ratio in compliance with the requirements of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Our median employee was identified from our total employee population (excluding the CEO) as of December 31, 2017, using total gross earnings for 2017 as our consistently applied compensation measure, without annualizing the compensation of individuals who were employed for less than the full year. We then calculated that median employee's annual total compensation for 2017 in the same manner used for the Named Executive Officers in the Summary Compensation Table above. For 2017, our median employee's (excluding the CEO) annual total compensation was $50,771 and our Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation was $6,756,680. As such, our CEO to Employee Pay Ratio is 13332to 1. The Company believes that because companies may employ differing methodologies and/or assumptions to determine the pay ratio, this pay ratio should not be relied upon when comparing the Company to other companies or to its peers. 36Director CompensationThe following table sets forth the compensation for 201732for those individuals who served as members of the Company's Board of Directors during 201732(excluding Named Executive Officers whose director compensation is included in the Summary Compensation Table).Name160Fees Earned orPaid in Cash ($)160RSUAwards ($)160All OtherCompensation ($)160Total ($)160160160160160160160160160160Dr. Thomas A.

Other compensation was excluded for purposes of creating the listing of all employees and employees who were employed for fewer than six months of the year were excluded from the listing. Employees outside of the United States were included in the list without making cost of living adjustments.Employment AgreementsThe Company has employment agreements in place with each of its named executive officers. Among other things, these employment agreements set the initial annual base salaries for each named executive officer, establish that each named executive officer is eligible to participate in the Company's executive annual cash incentive program and set forth certain termination benefits in the event his or her employment with the Company is terminated. The termination benefits to which our named executive officers would be entitled in the event of termination are described below in the section entitled 8220Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control.8221 The employment agreements with our named executive officers, except for the employment agreement with Mr. Probert, provide for a period of one year after the cessation of his or her employment during which he or she is subject to certain non-compete and non-solicitation covenants. In the case of Mr. Probert, his employment agreement provides for a period of 18-months after the cessation of his employment during which he is subject to certain non-compete and non-solicitation covenants.37POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROLThe benefits and payments that the Company8217s named executive officers could receive under certain hypothetical termination scenarios are described in the narrative below and quantified in the table that follows.Potential Payments upon Certain Termination ScenariosVoluntary Termination and Termination for CauseIf the employment of any of the Company8217s named executive officers is voluntarily terminated or terminated by the Company for cause, then no additional payments or benefits will accrue or be paid to the named executive officer under his or her employment agreement, other than what has been accrued and vested in the benefit plans discussed above in this proxy statement. A voluntary termination or involuntary termination for cause will not trigger an acceleration of the vesting of any stock options or other long-term incentive awards, and any such awards that had not already vested would be forfeited.Termination Without CauseUnder our employment agreements with our named executive officers, in the event that his or her employment is terminated by the Company without 8220cause8221 or by the named executive officer for 8220good reason,8221 as those terms are defined in the employment agreements, the named executive officer would be entitled to the following benefits and payments:8226Payment of all accrued and unpaid base salary through the date of such termination8226Monthly severance payments equal to one-twelfth of the named executive officer8217s base salary as of the date of termination for a period equal to 12 months, except in the case of our Chief Executive Officer who would receive such severance payments for a period of 18 months and8226Reimbursement for the cost the named executive officer incurs for continuation of his or her health insurance coverage under COBRA, and for his family members if he or she provided for their coverage during his or her employment, for a period of 12 months, except in the case of our Chief Executive Officer who would such reimbursement for a period of 18 months. Additionally, the Company8217s employment agreement with the Chief Executive Officer provides that the Company will pay him a pro-rata bonus, based on the number of full or partial calendar months he remained employed, for the year in which such termination occurs, which bonus shall be paid at the same time as similar bonuses are paid to the Company8217s executive employees for such year.A termination without cause will not trigger an acceleration of the vesting of any stock options or other long-term incentive awards, and any such awards that had not already vested would be forfeite\n",

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure Rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act require us to disclose the ratio of our CEO146s annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of the 147median compensated148 employee of all our employees (the 147Median Compensated Employee148) other than the CEO. The 2017 annual total compensation of the Median Compensated Employee as of October 2, 2017 other than our CEO, Mr. Nuti, was $58,506. Mr. Nuti146s 2017 annual total compensation, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 69, was $12,435,018. The ratio of these amounts was 1:213. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll records and the methodology described below. Because SEC rules for identifying the Median Compensated Employee and calculating the pay ratio based on his or her annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. As permitted under SEC rules, we used Target Total Cash, which includes base salary or base wages, target cash bonus incentives and other cash-based incentive allowances, such as housing, automobile, meal and other types of allowances, as reported in our payroll data, to determine our Median Compensated Employee. For hourly employees, we calculated base wages based on a reasonable estimate of hours worked during 2017 and the relevant employee146s hourly wage rate as in effect on October 2, 2017. For salaried employees, we calculated base salary using the relevant employee146s annual salary level as in effect on October 2, 2017. We annualized Target Total Cash for all permanent employees who did not work for all of 2017. As of October 2, 2017, NCR employed approximately 9,443 US employees and 20,419 non-US employees. In determining the Median Compensated Employee, we prepared a listing of approximately 9,442 of our US-based employees and approximately 19,011 of our non-US based employees who were employed as of October 2, 2017. This listing excluded our CEO and approximately 34 employees from Bosnia amp Herzegovina, 1 employee from Brunei, 13 employees from the Dominican Republic, 140 employees from Egypt, 30 employees from Ghana, 1 employee from Luxembourg, 121 employees from Nigeria, 92 employees from Pakistan, and 976 employees from the Philippines. The excluded non-US employees, in the aggregate, represent less than 5% of our total employee population. We then identified the Median Compensated Employee from that list, who was an employee from Chile. Because the median employee we initially identified had anomalous compensation characteristics, we substituted the identified Median Compensated Employee with a US employee with substantially similar compensation, based on the compensation measure used to select the Median Compensated Employee and determined this individual146s compensation in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-K, Item 402(c)(2)(x).  86 Table of Contents Related Person Transactions Under its charter, the Committee on Directors and Governance (CODG) is responsible for the review of all related person transactions.In January 2007 the Board formalized in writing a Related Person Transactions Policy that provides that each related person transaction must be considered for approval or ratification (i)by the Company146s CODG, or (ii)by all of the disinterested members of the Board, if the CODG so determines. The policy requires each director and executive officer of the Company to use reasonable efforts to report to the Company146s General Counsel any transaction that could constitute a related person transaction prior to undertaking the transaction.The General Counsel must advise the Chairman of the CODG of any related person transaction of which the General Counsel becomes aware, whether as a result of reporting or otherwise.The CODG then considers each such related person transaction, unless the Committee determines that the approval or ratification of such transaction should be considered by all of the disinterested members of the Board, in which case such disinterested members of the Board will consider the transaction.Except as set forth below, the Company will not enter into a related person transaction that is not approved in advance unless the effectiveness of the transaction is expressly subject to ratification by the CODG or the disinterested members of the Board, as applicable.

      "Pay RatioWe believe our executive compensation program must be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our employees to create stockholder value. As such, we annually monitor the relationship between the compensation of our executive officers and the compensation of our non-managerial employees. For 2017, the annual total compensation of Mr. Mumma, our Chief Executive Officer, of $2,403,971, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table (the 8220CEO Compensation8221), was approximately 10.24 times the annual total compensation of our median employee calculated in the same manner of $234,836.To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and the CEO Compensation, we took the following steps:8226We determined that, as of December16031, 2017, our employee population, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, consisted of 18 individuals. This population consisted of our full-time employees, as we did not have part-time, temporary or seasonal employees as of December16031, 2017. If any permanent employee was employed for less than the full fiscal year, we annualized such employee's total compensation.8226We used a consistently applied compensation measure to identify our median employee of comparing the annual base salary, incentive award (including restricted shares earned as part of an incentive award), bonus and any dividends paid on restricted shares for the year ended December16031, 2017. 8226We identified our median employee by consistently applying this compensation measure to all of our employees, excluding our Chief Executive Officer. Since all of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, are located in the United States, we did not make any cost of living adjustments in identifying the median employee. If such median employee8217s total compensation was not comparable to the CEO Compensation, for example, because such median employee was hired at the end of the year and thus did not receive long term incentive stock awards in 2017, we used the next lower employee who was comparable as the median employee.8226After we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee8217s compensation for the 201732year in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $234,836.8226With respect to the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, we used the amount calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K and reported in the 8220Total8221 column of the Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference in Item 11 of Part III of our 201732Annual Report.40Table of ContentsOther Compensation Arrangements160Restricted Stock Award Agreements160The restricted stock award agreements we entered into with our NEOs contain certain vesting and acceleration provisions with respect to a termination of employment as a result of death or disability or, in the case of our NEOs other than Mr. Mumma, in the event of a change in control. Under the restricted stock award agreements, if the NEO8217s employment with us is terminated due to death, the restricted shares issued under the agreement will become fully vested and non-forfeitable upon the date of death. If the NEO8217s employment with us is terminated due to disability, the restricted shares issued under the agreement will become fully vested and non-forfeitable upon the date of the termination of the NEO8217s employment. If we experience a change in control, the restricted shares issued under the agreement to our NEOs other than Mr. Mumma will become fully vested and non-forfeitable immediately upon the occurrence of the event causing the change in control. Pursuant to Mr. Mumma's employment agreement with us, unvested restricted shares held by Mr. Mumma will not accelerate or vest solely due to a change in control. Restricted stock award agreements entered into by us with the NEOs provides for the grant of shares of restricted common stock, one-third of which will vest and become non-forfeitable on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant subject to certain conditions. The holders of these restricted shares of common stock issued by us are entitled to (i) the payment of dividends on their unvested shares based on the same dividend rate per share as the dividends on our unrestricted common stock and (ii) vote their unvested shares.Performance Share Award AgreementOn May 28, 2015, the Compensation Committee approved a PSA to Mr. Mumma, at which time we entered into a performance share award agreement with Mr. Mumma.

      "Pay Ratio As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr.Workman, our Chief Executive Officer (our 147CEO148): For 2017, our last completed fiscal year:   149  the median of the estimated annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than our CEO), was $73,266 and   149  the annual total compensation of our CEO was $4,876,910. Based on this information, for 2017 our Chief Executive Officer146s annual total compensation was approximately sixty-seven times that of the median of the annual total compensation of all employees. To identify the median of the estimated annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the 147median employee,148 the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used were as follows: 1. As permitted under the SEC rules, in order to identify our median employee, we used a consistently applied compensation measure of estimated 145total cash compensation146 earned from January1, 2017 to December31, 2017. We used December31, 2017 for our employee listing and annualized total cash compensation for those permanent employees who commenced work during 2017. We did not adjust the size of our employee population or make any cost-of-living adjustments when identifying our median employee. 2. In calculating the estimated annual total compensation of the median employee and CEO, we identified and included the elements of such compensation in accordance with the requirement of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. We also included the estimated company cost of their respective Company-provided health and wellness benefits of $13,436 and $18,094, respectively therefore, the CEO146s total compensation for purposes of this calculation differs from the total compensation described in the summary of compensation table in this document by his health and wellness benefits amount. 3. We believe the pay ratio disclosed above is a reasonable estimate calculated in accordance with SEC rules, based on our records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use a variety of methodologies and apply various assumptions. The application of various methodologies may result in significant differences in the results reported by SEC reporting companies. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio we report above.  68 Table of Contents DIRECTOR COMPENSATION Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive compensation for serving on the Board of Directors.

      "Pay RatioPursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, presented below is the ratio of annual total compensation of the Company8217s Chief Executive Officer to the annual total compensation of the Company8217s median employee (excluding the Chief Executive Officer). The ratio presented below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u). In identifying the Company8217s median employee, the Company calculated the annual total cash compensation of each employee for the year ended December16031, 2017. Total cash compensation for this purpose included base salary, bonus and commissions and was calculated using the Company8217s payroll data. No cost-of-living adjustments were applied as part of the calculation. The Company selected the median employee based on 74,34132full-time, part-time and seasonal workers who were employed as of December16031, 2017. For employees that were hired during the year ended December16031, 2017, but did not work the full year, their compensation was annualized, but no full-time equivalent adjustments were made. Independent contractors or leased workers were not included in the population. Annual total compensation, as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K, for the Company8217s Chief Executive Officer was $2,886,93432for the year ended December16031, 2017. Annual total compensation, as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K, for the Company8217s median employee was $20,45332for the year ended December16031, 2017. The ratio of the Company8217s Chief Executive Officer8217s annual total compensation to its median employee8217s total compensation is 14132to 1 for the year ended December16031, 2017. Potential Payments on Termination or Change in ControlChange in Control AgreementsThe Company has entered into change in control severance agreements (8220the CIC Agreements8221) with its NEOs, which become effective only upon a Change in Control (as defined in the CIC Agreements). In addition, under the Company8217s incentive plans there is acceleration of vesting with respect to stock options and restricted stock awards upon a Change in Control (as defined in the applicable incentive plan).Pursuant to the terms of the CIC Agreements, if, within six months prior to or two years following a Change in Control, any of the NEOs8217 employment is terminated by the Company without 8220Cause,8221 by reason of death or 8220Disability,8221 or by the NEO for 8220Good Reason8221 (each, as defined in the CIC Agreements), then the executive will be entitled to8226continuation of salary for two years and a payment equal to two times the NEO8217s target bonus8226continuation of insurance coverage for two years8226any unpaid bonus for the immediately preceding year and a pro rata target bonus for the year of termination8226an amount equal to all earned but unused vacation days8226payment for outplacement services, up to $30,000 and not to exceed 24 months8226immediate vesting for all equity-based awards and immediate exercisability for 12 months for all outstanding stock options and8226all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in disputing the termination of the executive8217s employment.32The following table shows the amounts that those NEOs who have entered into CIC Agreements would have received if their employment had been terminated by the Company without Cause immediately following a Change in Control on December16031, 2017. The unvested stock option grants and unvested restricted share awards vest pursuant to the terms of the incentive plans upon a Change in Control irrespective of a termination of employment. This table does not include amounts related to the NEOs8217 vested benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan or pursuant to stock option grants or restricted share awards, which are described in the tables above.160David O'Reilly160Greg Henslee (a)160Greg D.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE  As required by applicable law and SEC regulation, we calculated a reasonable estimate of the ratio of the annual total compensation of John E. Fischer, our CEO, compared to that of our median employee in 2017.  Based on the information described below, for 2017, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 91.68 to 1.  We identified our median employee using the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates described below.  Employee Population and Compensation.As of December31, 2017, our global employee population consisted of 6,526 individuals working at Olin and its consolidated subsidiaries. This includes 5,536 U.S. employees.  Given the geographical distribution of our employee population, we use a variety of pay elements to structure the compensation arrangements of our employees.   183  Base salary and overtime pay151the fixed portion of compensation, paid without regard to financial or operational performance.   183  Annual cash bonus/variable compensation plans151in which approximately 70% of our full-time employees globally participate, and discretionary annual bonuses151for which 60% of the hourly employees in our manufacturing organizations in North America are eligible.   183  Other benefit programs, such as health insurance and retirement plan contributions, depending on the practices and laws of the country of employment, and for certain employees, equity awards.  Adjustment and Assumptions.We applied the allowed 147de minimis148 exception to exclude 325 employees in the following countries: China (130) Italy (48) South Korea (36) Switzerland (33) Netherlands (23) Japan (11) United Arab Emirates (8) Hong Kong (6) Taiwan (5) Russia (4) Singapore (3) Thailand (4) India (2) Denmark (1) Poland (1) Turkey (1) South Africa (1) United Kingdom (1) and Mexico (1). If we excluded any employees from a country using this de minimis exception, all employees from that country were excluded.  We selected gross earnings (unreduced by any pre-tax medical or other benefits in the U.S.) as the appropriate measure of compensation and applied the same measure for employees in non-U.S. countries. This approach allowed us to include all elements of compensation while simplifying the process of gathering the relevant information. It also allowed us to reasonably compare compensation for North American employees and that of employees in multiple international locations. We obtained the information for our non-North American-based employees from information maintained by a third party payroll processing provider in each country.  We considered gross earnings for all of our employees (other than those non-U.S. employees excluded under the 147de minimis148 exemption described above), during the 12-month period ended December31, 2017151our fiscal year. We did not make cost-of-living adjustments and did not annualize compensation of employees hired during 2017.  In calculating employee compensation of non-U.S. employees, we averaged the month-end exchange rates for each month in 2017 and applied this average exchange rate to the relevant foreign currencies to convert compensation to U.S. dollars.  67 Table of Contents Median Employee.Using the methodology described above, we determined that the 147median employee148 was a full-time, salaried non-exempt lab technician in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls division, working in the U.S., with gross earnings (wages, overtime pay and variable compensation) for the 12-month period ended December31, 2017 of approximately $78,838.  We determined the annual total compensation of this 147median employee148 by calculating the elements of 2017 compensation in accordance with the requirements that apply to the Summary Compensation Table for our NEOs on page 45. This resulted in annual total compensation of $84,855. As noted above, we used 2017 gross earnings to identify this employee as our median employee, which include the bonus for 2016 performance paid in 2017. The annual total compensation for the median employee calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Summary Compensation Table includes (i)the bonus for 2017 performance determined and paid in 2018, which was $1,025 higher, and (ii)employer contributions to the 401(k) plan and employer-paid life insurance premiums of $5,262.  For the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the 147Total148 column (column (j)) of our Summary Compensation Table on page 45.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure For 2017, the median of the annual total compensation determined in accordance with SEC rules of all of our employees, excluding our principal executive officer, was $46,321. For purposes of identifying our median compensated employee and computing this amount, we utilized payroll and income tax records as of December31, 2017. We included our entire employee population as of December31, 2017, and we did not make any cost-of-living or annualizing adjustments. Our principal executive officer's annual total compensation for 2017, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table for 2017 below and determined in accordance with SEC rules, was $420,470, or approximately 9.08 times the median of the annual total compensation determined in accordance with SEC rules of all of our employees, excluding our principal executive officer, for 2017. Investors are cautioned, however, that amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table for 2017 above for our named executive officers, including our principal executive officer, are determined pursuant to SEC rules that do not necessarily reflect amounts actually received or realized by, or value actually delivered to, our named executive officers, including our principal executive officer. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance or emphasis on such amounts or the ratio disclosed above. Further, upon closing of the Apollo-Vaumlrde Transaction (defined below), we expect to recognize non-cash incentive compensation expense of approximately $108million attributable to distributions in respect of SFH Incentive Units, a substantial portion of which will be attributable to our principal executive officer's SFH Incentive Units, along with a capital contribution offset such that the overall impact to our shareholders' equity will be neutral. As a result, if the Apollo-Vaumlrde Transaction (defined below) closes, the pay ratio disclosed above will be materially higher for 2018 compensation purposes. 44 Table of Contents Independent Director Compensation We pay compensation to our non-employee independent directors for their service as members of the Board and its Committees. Fees to independent directors may be paid in cash or, in lieu of cash, by issuances of our common stock based on the value of our common stock at the date of grant, provided that any such issuance does not prevent a director from being independent and the shares are granted pursuant to a stockholder approved plan. We also make annual grants of RSUs on the first day of each calendar year that vest one year after the grant date, subject to the director's continued service through the vesting date. In addition, upon joining the Board, each independent director received a one-time restricted stock grant that vests in annual installments over a three-year period, provided that the director is still serving as a director as of the applicable vesting date. Under the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan adopted by our Board and approved by our stockholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, no participant who is an independent director may receive cash and equity-based awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan valued at more than $500,000 during any calendar year. The Committee believes that these restrictions represent meaningful limits on the compensation payable to our independent directors. All members of the Board are also reimbursed for reasonable costs and expenses incurred in attending Board or committee meetings. Additionally, due to an administrative error by the Company in failing to provide timely and accurate tax information forms to the Company's independent directors for tax years 2014 and 2015, the Company has agreed to reimburse our independent directors for tax preparation and filing fees incurred in connection with amending their 2014 and 2015 tax returns, as well as any tax penalties and interest on underpayment of taxes associated therewith. Director Stock Ownership Policy On March25, 2016, the Board approved a Director Stock Ownership Policy to align the interests of our non-employee directors with those of our stockholders by encouraging significant stock ownership in the Company by our non-employee directors. Such policy is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. Pursuant to such policy, each non-employee director must at all times hold shares of our common stock with a value equal to three times the cash retainer for such director's annual Board service, excluding retainer fees for Board committee chair or committee member service. For purposes of determining compliance with such policy at any time, the value of the non-emp\n"

      "PAY RATIOParker Drilling employed 2,329 employees across the globe as of October 1, 2017. Our workforce consisted of 720 employees in our Russia operations, 603 employees in the United States, and the remainder in 19 countries, including over 100 employees in each of these countries: Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Canada, and Saudi Arabia. Compensation programs in each country are designed to be competitive in the local market, and employees are paid in local currency according to country pay practices regarding base salary, allowances, overtime, and benefits.Because stock-based compensation is granted to less than 6% of our employees, Total Cash Compensation paid in a 12-month period accurately reflects the actual wages or earnings of our global population, for the purpose of calculating the CEO Pay Ratio. Total Cash Compensation was collected from the payrolls in each country where we operate and annualized for those hired within the 12-month period. Data was collected for all employees, and no adjustments were made other than annualizing pay for new hires and converting to USD based on the average exchange rate over the period.

      "Pay Ratio32The NGampC Committee reviewed a comparison of CEO pay to the pay of all active employees as of December 31, 2017, as determined in accordance with the requirements of Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (the 8220Pay Ratio Rule8221). The compensation for our CEO in 2017 was approximately 18 times the median pay of our employees. We believe this ratio to be a reasonable estimate, based upon the assumptions and adjustments described below.Median employee total compensation:160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160$115,413CEO total compensation:160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160$2,116,322Ratio of CEO to median employee total compensation:16016016016016016016016018Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with the Pay Ratio Rule. The methodology to determine the median employee involved examining 2017 total cash compensation consisting of base salary and cash bonus for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 31, 2017. The value of matching contributions to the Company8217s 401(k) plan were included, but medical benefits were excluded, from total cash compensation. We included all active U.S. and non-U.S. employees of the company and our consolidated subsidiaries, whether employed on a full-time, part-time basis, or temporary basis. We do not have seasonal employees. Compensation was annualized for permanent employees, but not for temporary employees. Compensation at foreign subsidiaries was converted to U.S. dollars using the year-end spot rate. Target annual bonus amount was applied for 2017 new hires in order to have a consistent compensation measure. Other than discussed in the foregoing, we did not otherwise make assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to either base salary or cash bonus. We believe the use of total cash compensation consisting of base salary and cash bonus for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not broadly grant annual equity awards to employees. Because the median employee identified through application of the methodology was a new hire in 2017 with a target annual bonus for purposes of application of the methodology, we determined to substitute the next higher paid employee as the median employee who had substantially similar compensation, and was employed throughout 2017 and had received an actual determined cash bonus in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had 209 active U.S. and non-U.S. employees of the company and our consolidated subsidiaries. Employees of Pattern Development 1.0 are not our employees.The Pay Ratio Rule allows companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.Employment and Severance Agreements The named executive officers' employment agreements provide for an initial term of employment of one year and automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless either party provides a notice of non-renewal not less than 60 days prior to the next renewal date. The employment agreements also provide for a cash severance payment upon a termination by us without cause, by the named executive officer for good reason or due to a non-extension of the agreement at our election. 8220Cause8221 is defined for this purpose generally to mean (i)160a material breach of the employment agreement by the named executive officer that remains uncorrected for 30 days after we provide written notice to the named executive officer, (ii)160the named executive officer being the subject of an order obtained or issued by the SEC for any securities violation involving fraud, (iii)160the conviction or plea of nolo contendere by the named executive officer to any felony or crime involving moral turpitude or (iv)160the named executive officer8217s material mismanagement in providing material services to us or our affiliates if such mismanagement is not corrected for 30 days after we provide written notice to the named executive officer. 8220Good reason8221 is defined for this purpose generally to mean (i)160a material diminution in the named executive officer8217s authority, title, position, duties or responsibilities, (ii)160a material breach by us of our obligations to the named executive officer under the employment agreement or a material breach by us of our bylaws or certificate of incorporation\n"

      "Pay Ratio Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, we are required to calculate and disclose the total compensation paid to our median employee, as well as the ratio of the total compensation paid to the median employee as compared to the total compensation paid to our CEO. The paragraphs that follow describe our methodology and the resulting CEO pay ratio. We identified the median employee using our employee population on December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 7,600 employees located in the United States, Canada and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pursuant to the160de minimis160exception, in identifying the median employee, we excluded approximately 148 employees in Canada and two employees in UAE, which together represent approximately 2% of our workforce.Additionally, we excluded approximately 376 employees that became our employees as a result of our acquisition of MS Directional in October 2017. The compensation measure we used to identify the median employee was Box 1 of the Form W-2 issued by the IRS for federal tax purposes. We chose Form W-2 because our non-excluded employee population consisted solely of U.S. employees, and this compensation measure applies to all U.S. employees, allowing for accessibility and broad comparability. The total annual compensation for the year ended December 31, 2017 was calculated as $83,826 for our median employee and $14,253,838 for our CEO as reflected in the 8220Total8221 column of the Summary Compensation Table. The ratio of our CEO8217s pay to that of our median employee for 2017 was approximately 170 times.The pay ratio provided is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. We believe that the pay ratio described above is significantly higher for 2017 than it would be in prior years, due to the special, one-time awards granted to the CEO and other Named Executive Officers in connection with the transformative SSE merger. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee8217s annual total compensation allows companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio for our Company, as other companies have headquarters and offices in different states and countries, have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios. No Pension Benefits or Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Patterson-UTI does not provide any pension benefits for any of the Named Executive Officers.

      "Pay RatioAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of John P. McLaughlin, our Chief Executive Officer (our CEO). The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.For 2017, our last completed fiscal year:9642the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than our CEO) was $124,236 and9642the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, was $3,417,236.Based on this information, for 2017, the ratio of the median of the total compensation of all employees of the Company to the annual total compensation of, John P. McLaughlin, our CEO, was 1 to 27.5. 160Determining the Median EmployeeWe determined that, as of December 31, 2017, our employee population consistent of 34 individuals, with approximately 59% of these individuals located in the United States and approximately 41% located in Europe. Our employee workforce consists of full- and part- time employees. For purposes of determining our CEO pay ratio for 2017, we have excluded the 61 employees who were acquired as part of a business combination with LENSAR, Inc. in May 2017, as permitted by SEC rules. For purposes of measuring the compensation of our employees, we selected total annual cash compensation for 2017 as the most appropriate measure of compensation, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the 8220median employee8221. Compensation paid to our non-U.S. employees was converted to U.S. dollars based on the average exchange rate for 2017.64COMPENSATION OF OUR DIRECTORSThe Board has established its compensation policy for outside directors, which was most recently amended in March 2017 in consultation with the Compensation Committee8217s current compensation consultant, Board Advisory. Members of the Board who are also employees of the Company are not entitled to any compensation with respect to their service as Board members. 160Cash CompensationIn 2017, each outside director received a retainer of $100,000 per year, except for the Lead Director who received a retainer of $115,000 per year, for his or her service on the Board. Each outside director also received annual cash retainers for service on Board committees, as follows:8226Each member of the Audit Committee received a retainer of $17,500 per year, except for the chairperson of the Audit Committee who received a retainer of $30,000 per year, for his or her service on the Audit Committee.8226Each member of the Compensation Committee received a retainer of $15,000 per year, except for the chairperson of the Compensation Committee who received a retainer of $22,500 per year, for his or her service on the Compensation Committee.8226Each member of the Litigation Committee received a retainer of $10,000 per year, except for the chairperson of the Litigation Committee who received a retainer of $20,000 per year, for his or her service on the Litigation Committee.8226Each member of the Nominating and Governance Committee received a retainer of $2,500 per year, except for the chairperson of the Nominating and Governance Committee who received a retainer of $5,000 per year, for his or her service on the Nominating and Governance Committee.All cash compensation paid to outside directors for their service on the Board and its committees is paid on a quarterly basis in arrears.We also reimburse our directors for their reasonable travel expenses for Board and committee meetings. The Board annually sponsors a multi-day off-site meeting to which the Board members may bring their spouses. When we hold such a meeting, we reimburse the Board members for their spouses8217 reasonable travel expenses for such off-site meeting. 160Equity CompensationWe provide our outside directors with grants of restricted stock as a portion of their total compensation to ensure that our outside directors own common stock in the Company and their interests are aligned with our stockholders. In March 2017, in consultation with the Compensation Committee8217s compensation consultant and in acknowledgment of the Company8217s stock performance during 2016, the Board amended the compensation policy to reduce the amount of the annual grant of restricted stock to our outside directors from a grant date value of $250,000 to a grant date value of $150,000 under our Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive160Plan, based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSUREAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Jon E. Bortz, our Chief Executive Officer (our 8220CEO8221). We consider the pay ratio specified below to be a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.For 2017, our last completed fiscal year:648226the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our CEO) was $134,7318226the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement, was $3,931,846 and8226the annual total compensation of our CEO was approximately 29 times the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our CEO).To determine the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our CEO), the Company prepared a list of all 27 employees (other than our CEO) as of December 31, 2017 and calculated each employee8217s annual total compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCESection16016(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires the Company8217s executive officers and trustees, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company8217s equity securities (8216821610% Holders8221), to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC.

      "Pay Ratio We determined our 8220median employee8221 by: (1) calculating the annual total compensation for each of the part-time and full-time employees of Peoples or one of our subsidiaries who was employed as of December 31, 2017, except Mr. Sulerzyski, with annual total compensation for this purpose calculated by adding base salary and overtime pay plus any cash incentive and equity-based incentive payments vested in 2017 plus the amount of any 8220company match8221 under Peoples 401(k) Plan plus any wellness incentive payment (2) ranking the annual total compensation of all employees except Mr. Sulerzyski from lowest to highest and (3) identifying the middle employee in the list as the 8220median employee.8221Once the median employee was identified, we used the annual total compensation for 2017 for such employee calculated in the manner described in the preceding sentence. We then used Mr. Sulerzyski8217s annual total compensation for 2017 as disclosed in the 8220SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE FOR 20178221 appearing on page 74 of this Proxy Statement. The calculations yielded the following numbers and ratio:  8226160160160160Annual total compensation of Mr. Sulerzyski  $1,072,999 8226160160160160Median employee's annual total compensation  $43,876 8226160160160160Ratio of annual total compensation of Mr. Sulerzyskito the median employee's annual total compensation:  24.46to 1.0  71 Summary The Compensation Committee believes that the best measure of whether the executive compensation program is achieving its intended goals is to look at the long-term performance of Peoples, as well as the relative changes in performance during any given time period. Peoples' NEOs received payouts under the incentive compensation program based upon the levels of corporate and individual performance achieved for 2017. In light of the results previously described in this 8220EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION: COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS,8221 the Compensation Committee believes Peoples' compensation program for its NEOs continues to be aligned with the interests of our shareholders. The incentive compensation program is a performance-based system that provides a balanced foundation for strong and effective leadership into the future, and ensures alignment with long-term shareholder interests without encouraging unnecessary and excessive risk-taking that could threaten the value of Peoples. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the disclosure included under the caption 8220EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION: COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS8221 required by Item 402(b) of SEC Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee authorizes the section captioned 8220EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION: COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS8221 be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into Peoples' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Discussion of Risk Review and Assessment Peoples' Senior Vice President, Director of Risk Management has conducted an assessment of Peoples' 2017 compensation programs and has reviewed, evaluated and discussed the assessment and the compensation programs with the Compensation Committee. The most recent review and discussion with the Compensation Committee with respect to Peoples' 2017 compensation programs occurred on June 22, 2017, and covered the senior management and executive compensation plans in which the NEOs were eligible to participate. The review of these plans took into consideration: (i) products and services incented (ii) the risk time horizon of those products and services (iii) incentives paid as a percentage of total revenue and (iv) incentives paid as a percentage of each participant's total compensation. Broad-based welfare and benefit plans that do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of NEOs were excluded from the review. The Compensation Committee believes that Peoples' overall compensation practices for its NEOs, which include the following elements, limit the ability of these officers to benefit from taking unnecessary and excessive risks:   x2022 Balance between base salary, and cash and equity-based incentive compensation opportunities  x2022 Maximum payouts which limit overall payout potential  x2022 Balance between short-term (cash) and long-term (equity-based) incentive compensation opportunities  x2022 Use of a balanced scorecard approach in setting performance goals with interacting, complementary incentive objectives that discourage emphasis on any single objective  x2022 Peoples' tone at the top and culture of ethically doing the right thing  x2022 Grants of only\n"

We selected December 31, 2017, as our identification date for determining our median employee because it enabled us to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economic manner.1608226We used a consistently applied compensation measure to identify our median employee by comparing the amount of salary or wages, bonuses and restricted stock units (cash and stock settled) that vested in 2017 as reflected in our payroll records. We did not hire anyone in 2017, so it was not necessary to annualize anyone8217s salary.1608226We identified our median employee by consistently applying this compensation measure to all of our employees included in our analysis. Since all of our employees, including our CEO, are located in the U.S., we did not make any cost of living adjustments in identifying the median employee.1608226After we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee8217s compensation for the 2017 year in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $142,935.1608226With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used Mr. Goodson8217s salary, bonus, restricted stock units and performance unit awards that vested and all other compensation for the 2017 year in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $1,661,477.42Securities Authorized For Issuance Under Equity Compensation PlansThe following table sets forth information regarding our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2017:Equity Compensation Plan Information160Plan category160Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights (1)160Weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights160Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column (a))160(2)160160(a)160(b)160(c)160160160160160160160Equity compensation plans approved by security holders 1601,608,646160$6.201601,416,993160160160160160160160Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders 160016001600160160160160160160160Total 1601,608,646160$6.201601,416,993160160160160160160160160160160160160(1)Includes options outstanding under the 1998 Incentive Plan, the 2013 Incentive Plan and the 2016 Incentive Plan.

      "Pay Ratio DisclosurePursuant to the Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are required to disclose in this proxy statement the following information for the 2017 fiscal year:8226the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (excluding our CEO) 8226the annual total compensation of our CEO and8226the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the total annual compensation of all of our employees (excluding our CEO). Based on Item 402(u) and applicable SEC guidance and applying the methodology described below, we have determined that our CEO8217s annual total compensation for 2017 was $4,429,766, and our reasonable good faith estimate of the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (excluding our CEO) for 2017 was $77,068. Accordingly, we estimate the ratio of our CEO8217s annual total compensation for 2017 to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (excluding our CEO) for 2017 was 5732to 1.We selected December16031, 2017, which is a date within the last three months of fiscal 2017, as the date we would use to identify our median employee. To identify the median employee from our employee population, we used the amount of salary, bonus, other cash compensation, and, to the extent applicable, the value of equity awards made to employees under the Company8217s 2013 Equity Plan. We used our payroll records to identify this information. In making this determination, we did not annualize compensation for those employees who did not work for the Company for the entire fiscal year. We also did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the median employee. We believe total compensation, including the value of equity awards granted to employees under the Company8217s Equity Plan in 2017 is an appropriate and consistently applied compensation measure because a significant number of our employees participate in the Equity Plan.Under Item 402(u) and applicable SEC guidance, each company has considerable flexibility to use a compensation measure to identify its median employee, provided the measure is consistently applied to all employees included in the calculation. Additionally, companies are afforded significant discretion as to the assumptions, adjustments and estimates it uses to identify the median employee or to determine annual total compensation of the median employee. Therefore, our 2017 pay ratio is not intended to facilitate a comparison to the pay ratio disclosed by any other company, including any company in our peer group.45Equity Compensation Plan InformationThe table below presents information as of December 31, 201732for the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

With the exception of performance-based restricted stock units issued to certain officers in 2015, which vested at the actual performance level of 167.6%, performance-based restricted stock units are reflected at maximum levels for each of the awards because actual performance through December16031, 201732was either at maximum level or between threshold and maximum levels for each of the awards under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. With the exception of the 2015 performance-based restricted stock units, the actual number of performance-based restricted stock units granted has not been determined and will be determined based on the Company8217s performance over the 3-year performance periods applicable to each award.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item402(u) of RegulationS-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Greg L. Armstrong, our CEO: 149 The annual total compensation for our CEO for 2017 was approximately $42,500. 149 The annual total compensation for the median employee for 2017 was approximately $96,900. 149 The ratio of our CEO's pay to the pay of our median employee for 2017 was approximately 0.44to1. The median annual total compensation was determined as follows: 149 A list was prepared of all individuals, excluding the CEO, who were employed by us on December31, 2017. We included all U.S. and Canadian employees. 149 Basic wage data for each U.S. employee was extracted from FormW-2 information provided to the Internal Revenue Service for calendar year 2017. Basic wage data for each Canadian employee was extracted from Form T4 information provided to the Canada Revenue Agency for calendar year 2017 and converted to U.S. dollars. This information was then sorted and the median employee was identified. 149 Once the median employee was identified, his or her annual total compensation for 2017 was determined using the same methodology we used for determining the annual total compensation for our Named Executive Officers as set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table. 39 Table of Contents Compensation of Directors The following table sets forth a summary of the compensation paid to each person who served as a non-employee director of PAGPGP in 2017: Name  Fees Earned or Paid in Cash ($)  Stock Awards ($)(1)  Total ($)  Victor Burk   60,000   51,225   111,225  Oscar K.

      "pay ratios are aligned to effectively drive stockholder value and does not set specific benchmarks for overall compensation or allocations between different elements and types of compensation.Role of Our StockholdersWe value our relationships with our stockholders. All stockholders are welcome to submit suggestions regarding our governance, including our Executive compensation practices to Plantronics, Inc., 345 Encinal Street, Santa Cruz, California 95060, Attn: Investor Relations, or made by phone at 831-426-5858. Annually, stockholders cast an advisory vote on our NEO compensation (\"say-on-pay\"). At our 201732Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our say-on-pay proposal received approval of 90% of the votes cast. This followed the say-on-pay vote at our 201632Annual Meeting at which over 91% of the votes cast were also in favor. 3242Based on our outreach and prior stockholder voting results, the Committee believes our stockholders strongly support our approach to NEO and Executive compensation. To further align our Executives' interests with those of our stockholders and based on feedback from investors, the Committee chose to replace the time-based stock options portion of our historical Executive compensation with performance-based restricted stock units (\"PSUs\") tied to the comparative performance of our common stock against an index of comparable listed companies. A further description of our PSUs can be found in the Section \"Fiscal Year 201832NEO Equity Awards\" of this Proxy Statement. The Committee also chose in the second quarter of fiscal year 201832to align our equity award and accounting practices with our peers by issuing the majority of our time-based equity awards in the form of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") in lieu of restricted stock awards (\"RSAs\"). Role of ManagementThe Committee conducts an annual review of Executive compensation to determine if changes are appropriate. As part of this process, our CEO, Human Resources personnel and other appropriate personnel provide the Committee with an assessment of each Executive's prior year performance against her or his specific performance objectives for the year and her or his influence on overall corporate performance. Based on his assessments, together with information provided by our compensation consultant, our CEO recommends each Executive's compensation package and performance objectives for each fiscal year. Our CEO does not participate in any assessment of his own performance nor make any recommendation with respect to his own compensation package.Following a review of management8217s recommendations, the Committee approves the compensation recommendations for the Executives with modifications the Committee considers appropriate. The Committee may also adjust compensation for specific individuals at other times during the year as it deems advisable.Role of Our Compensation ConsultantOur independent third party compensation consultant, Compensia, provides information, analysis and advice regarding Executive compensation practices and reports directly to the Committee Chair.The Committee considers a variety of factors when evaluating the capabilities and independence of compensation consultants including, the consultant's provision of other services to us, the fees paid or expected to be paid, the consultant's policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest, any business or personal relationships between members of the Committee or members of executive management and the consultant or its personnel, and whether the consultant or its personnel own any of our stock. For fiscal year 2018, the Committee determined there were no conflicts of interest with Compensia and Compensia was independent.At the Committee's direction, Compensia provided various services in connection with fiscal year 201832Executive compensation including: (i) advice on targets and funding metrics for our Executive compensation program (ii) ongoing advice on the design of our annual cash-based Executive Incentive Plans, Associate Incentive Plan and equity incentive plans generally (iii) assistance assessing risks related to our compensation programs and (iv) information on executive and non-employee director compensation including trends, developments and market practices. A Compensia representative attended a majority of the meetings and executive sessions of the Committee in fiscal year 2018. Additionally, its personnel contacted our employees for information and assistance necessary to fulfill its assignments and provide reports and presentations to and on behalf of the Committee to our Executives and other employees. All decisions concerning the amount or form of Executive compensation are made by the Committee alone or in conjunction with our Board, although as a member of the Board, our CEO does not participate or vote on matters concerning his own compensation.Executive Compensation Market AnalysisExecutive rec\n",

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure Rule.Pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of the principal executive officer (\"PEO\"). The PEO of our Company is Mr.Marsh. We believe that our compensation philosophy must be consistent and internally equitable to motivate our employees to create shareholder value. The purpose of the new required disclosure is to provide a measure of the equitability of pay within the organization. We are committed to internal pay equity, and our Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay our PEO receives and the pay our non-executive employees receive. For 2017, the annual total compensation of Mr.Marsh, our PEO, of $3,130,100 as shown in the Summary Compensation Table above, was approximately 56 times the annual total compensation of $56,282 of a median employee calculated in the same manner. We identified the median employee using the amount reported as compensation on the employee's FormW-2 for the year ended December31, 2017 for all individuals who were employed by us on December31, 2017, the last day of our payroll year (whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis).

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE  In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, promulgated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, we are required to disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Baker, our CEO, relative to the median annual total compensation of all of our employees (excluding our CEO).  Based on SEC rules for this disclosure and the methodology described below, for 2017, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 10 to 1.  Employee Population.We selected December31, 2017, which is a date within the last three months of fiscal 2017, as the date we would use to identify our median employee. As of December 31, 2017, our global employee population consisted of 65 full-time employees at Progenics and its consolidated subsidiaries. This includes 55 U.S. employees.  Methodology.In determining the median employee, a list of all employees, exclusive of our CEO, Mr. Baker, was prepared based on active employees included in our payroll records as of December 31, 2017. We used base compensation as the measure to identify the median employee from this list. Salaries and wages were annualized for those employees who were not employed for the full year of 2017.  Pay-Ratio Calculation. The total annual compensation of the median employee was then calculated in the same manner as the total compensation disclosed for Mr. Baker in the Summary Compensation Table shown on page 30 of this proxy statement.  Annual total compensation of Mr. Baker , CEO  $2,313,136  Annual total compensation of the median employee   231,600  Ratio of CEO to median employee compensation    10:1    This pay ratio is an estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employeersquos annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.  35 Table of Contents  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT  The following table sets forth certain information as of March 31, 2018, except as noted, regarding the beneficial ownership of the common stock by (i) each person or group known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock outstanding, (ii) each of our directors and executive officers, and (iii) all of our directors and executive officers as a group.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the Company is providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of David Zalman, the Company8217s Chief Executive Officer. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the Company8217s median employee and the Chief Executive Officer, the Company took the following steps:  x2022 We determined that, as of December 31, 2017, the Company8217s full-time and part-time employee population consisted of 3,073 individuals (including the Chief Executive Officer) and all of these individuals were located in the United States.  x2022 To identify the 8220median employee8221 (other than the Chief Executive Officer), we compared the compensation amounts from the Company8217s payroll records as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for 2017. In making this determination, we did not annualize the compensation of full or part-time employees who were hired in 2017, but did not work for the Company for the entire fiscal year. Further, in accordance with SEC rules we did not make full-time equivalent adjustments to the Company8217s 308 part-time employees.  x2022 Because we had an even number of employees after eliminating the Chief Executive Officer, we could not identify a mathematical median employee.Therefore we have identified the median employee as the employee that had the lesser of W-2 earnings from the two employees that would be averaged in a mathematical median calculation. 36  x2022 Once we identified the median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee's compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K resulting in annual total compensation of our median employee of $33,897  x2022 To determine the annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, we used the amount reported in the 8220Total8221 column of the Summary Compensation Table appearing on page 28, which was calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.  Based on this information, for 2017, the ratio of the annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is 70 to 1.  SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and various assumptions and, as a result, the pay ratio reported by the Company may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.  The information disclosed in this section was developed and is provided solely to comply with specific, new legal requirements. The Company does not use any of this information in managing the Company. The Company does not believe this information provides shareholders with a useful mechanism for evaluating management's effectiveness, operating results, or business prospects, nor for comparing the Company with any other company in any meaningful respect. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation During 2017, no executive officer of the Company served as (1) a member of a compensation committee (or other Board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire Board) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Compensation Committee, (2)160a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Compensation Committee or (3)160a member of the compensation committee (or other Board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire Board) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director of the Company.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure As required by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation of our median employee to the annual total compensation of Alan Auerbach, our President and Chief Executive Officer (our 147CEO148). We consider the pay ratio specified below to be a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with the requirements of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.  36 Table of Contents For 2017, our last completed fiscal year:   149  the annual total compensation of the employee who represents our median compensated employee (other than our CEO) was $445,782 and   149  the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table above, was $2,787,885. Based on this information, for 2017, the annual total compensation of our CEO was approximately 6.25 times the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than the CEO). Employee Population The Company used our employee population data as of December31, 2017, as the reference date for identifying our median employee. As of such date, our employee population consisted of approximately 317 individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer. Our employee workforce for purposes of our pay ratio calculation consists of full-time employees. Methodology for Determining Our Median Employee To identify the median employee from our employee population, we calculated each employee146s 2017 base salary, actual bonus paid in 2017 and grant-date fair value of equity awards granted in 2017, as equity awards are widely distributed throughout our employee base. In identifying the median employee, we annualized the compensation of all full-time employees who were new-hires in 2017 and on leave of absence in 2017. Annual Total Compensation With respect to the annual total compensation of the employee who represents our median compensated employee, we calculated such employee146s compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. We used the amount reported in the 147Total148 column of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement for the annual total compensation of our CEO.  37 Table of Contents EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION The following table sets forth the equity awards outstanding under the Plans as of December31, 2017:  Plan Category  Number ofShares to beissued uponexercise ofoutstandingoptions,warrantsandrights ()   Weighted-averageexerciseprice ofoutstandingoptions,warrants andrights ($)(1)   NumberofSharesremainingavailable forfuture issuanceunder equitycompensationplans (excludingsharesreflectedinthe first column)()  Equity compensation plan approved by security holders(2)   7,772,175 (3)   87.91    2,650,569  Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders(4)   233,250 (5)   151    766,750              Total   8,005,425    87.91    3,417,319               (1) Represents the weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options.

This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules.We identified the employee with compensation at the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees using the following methodology.In determining our employee population, we considered the individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us and our consolidated subsidiaries on December 31, 2017, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, seasonal or temporary basis. We did not include any contractors or other non-employee workers in our employee population. To identify our median employee, we chose to use a consistently-applied compensation measure, which we selected as base salary and annual incentive compensation paid for the 12-month period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. For simplicity, we calculated annual base pay using a reasonable estimate of the hours worked during 2017 for hourly employees and actual salary paid for our remaining employees. For permanent employees hired during 2017, we annualized their salary or base pay as if they had been employed for the entire measurement period. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustment.Using this methodology, we identified the individual at the median of our employee population. We then calculated the annual total compensation for this individual using the same methodology we use to calculate the amount reported for our CEO in the \"Total\" column of the 2017 Summary Compensation Table as set forth in this proxy statement.160As disclosed in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table, the annual total compensation for our CEO was $6,135,869.Because SEC rules for identifying the median of the annual total compensation of all employees allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, apply certain exclusions, and make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee population and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to our pay ratio, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may have used different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios. As explained by the SEC when it adopted these rules, the rule was not designed to facilitate comparisons of pay ratios among different companies, even companies within the same industry, but rather to allow stockholders to better understand and assess each particular company8217s compensation practices and pay ratio disclosures.Summary of Equity Plans2007 Stock Plan Our 2007 Plan, was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders in July1602007. Our 2007 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights to our employees, directors and consultants who provide services to us. As of December16031, 2017, options to purchase 1,587,415 shares of common stock were outstanding and no future awards will be made under such plan. Our 2007 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of all outstanding equity awards granted under the 2007 Plan. As of December16031, 2017, no awards had been granted under the 2007 Plan other than incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. Our standard form of option agreement under the 2007 Plan provides that options will vest 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date with the remainder vesting ratably over the next 36160months, subject to continued service through each applicable date. Our standard form of option agreement provides that in the event of a change in control, if the options are (i)160not assumed or continued by the successor corporation, (ii)160not exercised by the holder prior to the transaction or (iii)160not cashed out at the time of the transaction, then the options will vest in full effective as of the time of the change in control. In addition, our standard form of option agreement provides that if a participant, within 12160months of a change of control, (i)160is terminated without cause or (ii)160resigns for good reason, or if the acquiring company does not assume or substitute for any options held by such participant, then all of then unvested stock options shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full.

      "Pay Ratio  Under SEC rules, we are required to disclose the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (other than our CEO), as well as the ratio of this amount to the annual total compensation paid to our CEO. This ratio is an estimate calculated in accordance with SEC rules, which allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions based on their compensation practices. Therefore, the ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the ratio we report.  For 2017, the annual total compensation of the median compensated of all our employees (other than our CEO) was $48,194, and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $10,368,835, including, in each case, the cost of Company-paid broad-based benefits, including 401(k) and health, disability and life insurance. Therefore, our median employee to CEO pay ratio was estimated to be approximately 1 to 215.  In identifying the median employee, we used December 31, 2017 as our determination date and focused on our employee population as of that date. We considered the compensation of 43,845 individuals this excludes approximately 670 employees who work at Med Fusion and Cleveland Heart Lab Inc., both of which we acquired in 2017. Applying the 5% ldquoDe Minimis Exemptionrdquo permitted under SEC rules, we excluded workers, representing approximately 2% of our workforce, located in the following countries (with the number of excluded employees set forth in parentheses following the country): India (390) Mexico (368) Canada (104) Brazil (12) Ireland (9) and China (2). To identify our median employee, we used 2017 wages reported to the Internal Revenue Service, annualized for employees who were employed on December 31, 2017 but did not work for us for all of 2017.  Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance  The Company believes that all required reports have been timely filed since January 1, 2017 under the SECrsquos rules for reporting transactions by executive officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock.

The Committee relies primarily on peer group analyses and general survey data in determining annual salary increases while also considering the Trust8217s overall performance, the individual8217s experience, current performance and potential for advancement. The Committee determined to increase each of Mr. Gershenson8217s, Mr. Hendrickson8217s and Mr. Bedrosian8217s base salaries by 3.0% for 2017.160The Committee further determined to increase the 2017 base salaries for Ms. Clark by 6.3% and Mr. Eickhoff by 3.0%.24The following table sets forth the base salaries approved for the named executive officers in 201632and 201732and the percentage by which such base salaries increased in 2017 over the respective 2016 base salary amounts.

In March 2017, the Committee approved the adoption of the 201732Executive Incentive Plan for the Trust8217s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Committee tied payment of any bonuses under the 2017 Executive Incentive Plan to the following corporate financial objectives: (1) to maximize income and cash flow, with a target Operating FFO (funds from operations, as adjusted for certain one-time items) of $1.36 per diluted share, (2) to strategically acquire or dispose of properties, with target total values of acquisitions of $250 million and dispositions of $250 million during 2017 and (3) to operate with acceptable levels of leverage or a maximum ratio of net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA with a target of 6.6X. The target bonus for the Chief Executive Officer was 125% of base salary and for the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer was 75% of base salary. For 2017, the base salary increases of 3.0% for each of Mr.160Gershenson, Mr. Hendrickson and Mr. Bedrosian resulted in the same increase in the respective cash value of each such officer8217s target annual bonus. Bonus payout levels may be at threshold (50% of target incentive), target (100% of target incentive) or maximum (200% of target incentive) for each of the Operating FFO and strategic acquisition and disposition metrics, with a linear increase in payout between such levels, and the resulting percentage of target bonus earned may be reduced or increased for the Trust's actual net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA ratio. See \"8212Earned Bonus\" below for additional information on the financial metrics and their impact on bonus payments. For purposes of the 2017 Executive Incentive Plan, annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA means earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of the Trust8217s consolidated businesses, excluding gains, losses and impairment charges on real estate assets (except for gains on land sales in the ordinary course of business) and gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, calculated by annualizing such amounts from the fourth quarter of the year. For 2017, the Committee determined that the fourth quarter of 2017 was burdened by two expenses which, for purposes of determining annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 year, should be adjusted. Accordingly, the Committee adjusted expenses for the quarter for purposes of calculating 2017 annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA (i) to eliminate a one-time expense of $100,000 for Chief Executive Officer search fees incurred in the fourth quarter and (ii) to normalize over the entire year the costs incurred in the fourth quarter for an investor day held in the fourth quarter. Annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.Earned Bonus.

      "Pay Ratio As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of David Liniger, who served as our principal executive officer for all of 2017. We identified the median employee by examining the compensation (including base salary, bonuses, commissions, incentives, and overtime) of all of our employees, other than Mr. Liniger, as of November 15, 2017. We annualized the compensation of all employees and selected the median employee. The total compensation of the employee identified as the median employee at our Company was $92,777. This includes base salary of $68,300 cash bonus of $11,650 401(k) match of $9,000 $2,400 related to complimentary use of a golf course owned by David and Gail Liniger and a tax gross-up of $1,427 related to the use of the golf course. For all employees, the compensation charge for the golf course use was taken and the gross-up was paid in 2017 but both the charge and the gross up related to use of the golf course in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The amount for the cash bonus also includes a tax gross-up of $119 for a special $200 bonus that was paid in cash. Mr. Liniger has not received compensation, other than standard employee benefits, since our IPO in 2013. His compensation in 2017 was $0. The ratio of Mr. Linigerx2019s compensation to that of the median employee was zero. Employee Benefit and Stock Plans The 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan Prior to our IPO, our Board of Directors adopted the RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the x201COmnibus Planx201D) and our stockholders voted in 2017 to reapprove the Omnibus Plan. The Omnibus Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section422 of the Code, to our employees and any parent and subsidiary employees, and for the grant shares of our ClassA common stock, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalent rights, cash-based awards (including annual cash incentives and long-term cash incentives), and any combination thereof to our employees, directors, and consultants and to employees, directors, and consultants of any affiliated entity, including RMCO and its subsidiaries. Thisis a summary of the principal features of the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan. This summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of all of the provisions of the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of the Record Date, approximately 40 officers, 415 other employees, and eight non-employee directors were eligible to participate in the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The administrator of the Omnibus Plan also has discretion to grant awards to consultants. We have not historically granted awards to consultants and, as of the Record Date, there are no consultants the administrator would likely consider for the grant of awards. Such persons are eligible to participate in the Omnibus Plan on the basis that such participation provides an incentive, through ownership of the Companyx2019s common stock, to continue in service to the Company and related entities, and to help the Company compete effectively with other enterprises for the services of qualified persons. Share Reserve The Omnibus Plan provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance thereunder on the first business day of each fiscal year, beginning with our fiscal year following the year of our IPO, equal to one percent of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on the last day of our immediately preceding fiscal year, on a fully diluted basis or a lower number of shares determined by the planx2019s administrators. After giving effect to all outstanding awards (assuming maximum achievement of performance goals for performance-based awards), there were 2,379,333 shares available for future awards under the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as of the Record Date. 29  Table of Contents Administration The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the Omnibus Plan and is referred to as the x201Cadministrator.x201D The administrator has the power to determine and interpret the terms and conditions of the awards, including the employees, directors, and consultants who will receive awards, the exercise price, the number of shares subject to each such award, the vesting schedule and exercisability of the awards, the restrictions on transferability of awards, and the form of consideration payable upon\n",

      "Pay Ratio We are not required to disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO and the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (commonly known as 147pay ratio disclosure148) under applicable SEC rules because we only ceased to be an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act at the outset of our fiscal year beginning on January1, 2018. We will provide the pay ratio disclosure when first required in our proxy statement for our 2019 Annual Meeting. Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices We have assessed our compensation programs for all employees and have concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company. We believe that our compensation programs reflect an appropriate mix of compensation elements and balance current and long-term performance objectives, cash and equity compensation, and risks and rewards. During 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed our compensation policies and practices for all employees, including our NEOs, particularly as they relate to risk management practices and risk-taking incentives. As part of its review, the Compensation Committee discussed with management the ways in which risk is effectively managed or mitigated as it relates to our compensation programs and policies. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee believes that our compensation programs do not encourage excessive risk but instead encourage behaviors that support sustainable value creation. The following features of our executive compensation program illustrate this point.   149  Review by Independent Compensation Consultant. Our executive compensation programs have been designed and reviewed by an independent compensation consultant.   149  Compensation Committee Oversight. Our executive compensation programs are regularly reviewed and overseen by an independent Compensation Committee that retains the discretion to reduce compensation based on corporate and individual performance and other factors.   149  Mix of Incentives. Our compensation programs provide an appropriate mix of short-term and long-term incentives, as well as cash and equity opportunities.   149  Mix of Performance Metrics. The performance metrics associated with our incentive programs incorporate a variety of drivers of the business over both annual and three-year time horizons.   149  Strong Link to Stockholder Interests. Equity components and long-term performance metrics create a strong alignment between our executives146 interests and our stockholders146 interests. Because long-term incentives typically vest over a three-year period, our executives will always have unvested awards that could decrease in value if our business is not well-managed for the long term.   149  Alignment with Annual Plan and Long-Term Strategic Plan. Performance metrics in our short- and long-term incentive programs are aligned with both our annual budget and our long-term strategic plan.  35 Table of Contents  149  Appropriate Policies. We have adopted a 147clawback148 policy, a stock ownership and retention policy, and prohibitions against hedging and pledging, thereby creating additional protections for the Company and encouraging an alignment of our executives146 and stockholders146 interests.   149  Field Incentive Plan. Our operations field incentive plan is focused on growth, control, and profit151the three primary drivers of success in our branches. This creates appropriate alignment of employee incentive opportunities with company goals.   149  Administration and Disclosure. Administrative procedures, communication, and disclosure processes closely align with 147best practices.148   149  Securities Trading Policy. Officers must obtain permission from the General Counsel before the purchase or sale of any shares, even during an open trading period. Based on the factors above, we believe thatour NEOs and other employees are encouraged to manage our company in a prudent manner and thatour incentive programs are not designed to encourage our NEOs or other employees to take excessive risks or risks that are inconsistent with the Company146s and our stockholders146 best interests. In addition, we have in place various controls and management processes that help mitigate the potential for incentive compensation plans to materially and adversely affect the Company.  36 Table of Contents COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the foregoing 147Compensation Discussion and Analysis148 with management.\n"

Betz, our CEO. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. Given the different methodologies that companies may use to determine their CEO pay 59  ratio, the ratio reported below may not be comparable to the ratios reported by other companies. The values are as follows for 2017, our last completed fiscal year:  149  Mr. Betz146s annual total compensation151$4,107,393  149  Our median employee146s annual total compensation151$134,280  149  Ratio of Mr. Betz146s annual total compensation to our median employee146s annual total compensation15131:1 To identify the median employee, we took the following steps:  149  We selected December 31, 2017 as the determination date for purposes of identifying the median employee. Our employee population as of this date was 217, which included all full-time, part-time and temporary employees. All of our employees are located in the UnitedStates. In calculating this number, we did not use any of the exemptions permitted under SEC rules.  149  To determine the median employee, we identified a consistently applied compensation measure which would provide a reasonable picture of the annual compensation of our employees. For our consistently applied compensation measure, we used base salary plus short-term incentive awards and long-term incentive awards (valued at the grant date fair market value).  149  We identified the median employee by examining the compensation for all full-time, part-time and temporary employees, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 31, 2017. We adjusted estimates with respect to compensation by annualizing the base salary and cash short-term incentive compensation for any newly hired employees who were not employed by us for all of 2017. We then calculated the median employee146s compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, using the same methodology reflected in the Summary Compensation Table above. This resulted in annual total compensation for our median employee of $134,280.  149  Mr. Betz146s 2017 annual total compensation as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement was $4,107,393.

      "Pay Ratio  We believe our executive compensation program must be equitable to motivate our employees to create stockholder value. We monitor the relationship between the compensation of our executive officers and the compensation of our other employees. For 2017, the total compensation of Stuart A. Tanz, our President and Chief Executive Officer of $5,337,938, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table above, (our ldquoCEO Compensationrdquo), was approximately 46 times the total compensation of a median employee, which was calculated in the same manner, and was $116,307.  We identified the median employee using the annual base salary as of December 31, 2017, plus any cash bonuses received during 2017 and any long term incentive share awards vested in 2017 for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on December 31, 2017, the last day of our payroll year (whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis). If such median employeersquos total compensation was not comparable to the CEO Compensation, for example, because such median employee was hired at the end of the year and thus did not receive long term incentive share awards in 2017, we used the next lower employee who was comparable as the median employee. After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our CEO Compensation.  Pension Benefits  Our named executive officers received no benefits in 2017 from us under defined pension or defined contribution plans.

      "PAY RATIOAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation for Howard Schwimmer and Michael Frankel (our Co-CEOs) to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, excluding Mr. Schwimmer and Mr. Frankel (in each case, with annual total compensation calculated in accordance with SEC rules applicable to the Summary Compensation Table). We consider the pay ratio specified below to be a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with the requirements of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.For 2017, our last completed fiscal year: 8226the annual total compensation of our Co-CEOs, Mr. Schwimmer and Mr. Frankel, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table above, was $3,753,30332and $3,736,977, respectively.8226the annual total compensation of the employee who represents our median compensated employee (other than Mr. Schwimmer and Mr. Frankel) was $92,494.Based on this information, for 2017, the annual total compensation of Mr. Schwimmer and Mr. Frankel was approximately 4132times and 4032times the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our Co-CEOs), respectively.Determining the Median EmployeeEmployee PopulationWe used November1601, 201732as the reference date for identifying our median employee. As of such date, our employee population consisted of approximately 10432total employees, all of whom were located in the United States. For purposes of the pay ratio calculation, our employee population consists of all full- and part-time employees at all locations, including all temporary employees employed as of the measurement date.Methodology for Determining Our Median EmployeeTo identify the median employee from our employee population, we used total annual compensation (including base salary and bonus and equity payments, as applicable), calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. In identifying the median employee, we annualized the compensation of all full-time employees and we did not make any cost-of-living adjustments.Compensation Measure and Annual Total Compensation of Median EmployeeWith respect to the annual total compensation of the median employee, we calculated such employee8217s compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.Annual Total Compensation of CEOWith respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the 8220Total8221 column of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.3275EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATIONThe following table provides information as of December16031, 201732regarding compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance.Plan Category160Number of Securities to beIssued Upon Exercise ofOutstandingOptions, Warrants andRights (a)160Weighted AverageExercise Price ofOutstandingOptions, Warrantsand Rights (b)160Number of SecuritiesRemainingAvailablefor Future IssuanceUnder EquityCompensationPlans (Excluding Securities Reflected in Column (a))Equity compensation plans approved by security holders(1)160996,733(2)1608212160540,732Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders160821216082121608212Total160996,7331608212160540,732____________(1)Consists of the Incentive Award Plan, which was adopted by our Board in connection with the closing of our IPO in July 2013, and provides for awards of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, restricted stock units, performance awards, performance share awards, Service-Vesting LTIP Units, Performance-Vesting LTIP Units, stock payments and other incentive awards to be available for employees and consultants of our Company, our operating partnership and Rexford Industrial Realty and Management, Inc.

      "Pay Ratio In August 2015 pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), the SEC adopted Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median employee's annual total compensation.160 For 2018, this information is as follows: 160 8226 Mr. Sheaffer, Chief Executive Officer, annual total compensation: $413,819 8226 Median employee annual total compensation: $160 51,406 8226 Ratio of Chief Executive Officer to median employee compensation: 160160160 8.8:1.0 160 In determining the median employee, we used a listing of all employees, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, as of March 31, 2018.160 To identify our median employee, we included all elements of total direct compensation (defined as the total value of salaries, commissions, bonuses, and short-term incentive provided regularly and consistently to the 160 22 employee base) paid in fiscal year 2018 as our consistently applied compensation measure.160 Compensation for full-time employees hired during fiscal year 2018 was annualized. As a result of the flexibility permitted by Item 402(u), the method we used to determine our median employee may differ from the methods used by our peers, so the ratios may not be comparable. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The members of the Personnel/Compensation Committee are Directors Olson, Wills, Carlson and Nierenberg.160 No members of this Committee were officers or employees of Riverview or any of its subsidiaries during the year ended March 31, 2018, nor were they formerly Riverview officers or had any relationships otherwise requiring disclosure. PROPOSAL 2 8211 ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd-Frank Act\"), we are required to periodically include in our annual meeting proxy statements and present at the annual meeting of stockholders a non-binding stockholder resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in the proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.160 This proposal, commonly known as a \"say-on-pay\" proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the compensation of Riverview's named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement.160 The proposal will be presented at the annual meeting in the form of the following resolution: RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Riverview Bancorp Inc.'s named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related material in Riverview's Proxy Statement for the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. This vote will not be binding on our Board of Directors or Personnel/Compensation Committee and may not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty on the Board.160 It will also not affect any compensation paid or awarded to any executive.160 The Personnel/Compensation Committee and the Board may, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. The purpose of our compensation policies and procedures is to attract, retain and motivate key executives of proven ability who are critical to our future success.160 We believe that our compensation policies and procedures are strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.160 Our compensation programs are designed to balance short-term and long-term objectives, and to attract executive talent, retain a team of effective leaders and provide stability for Riverview.160 Our compensation program is guided by the philosophy that total executive compensation should vary based on achievement of corporate goals and objectives, and should closely align with Riverview's financial performance.160 The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors believes that the executive compensation for fiscal 2018 is reasonable and appropriate, is justified by Riverview's performance in an extremely difficult environment and is the result of a carefully considered approach. The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. 23 AUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS Audit Committee Charter.160 The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a charter approved by our Board of Directors.160 The charter sets out the responsibilities, authority and specific duties of the Audit Committee.160 The charter specifies, among other things, the structure and membership requirem\n",

The ratio presented below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item402(u) of RegulationS-K under the Exchange Act. In identifying our median employee, we calculated the annual total cash compensation of each employee for the twelve month period that ended on December31, 2017. Total cash compensation for these purposes included base salary, bonus, the value of restricted shares that vested during 2017 and dividends on unvested Company restricted shares and was calculated using internal payroll/tax records. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation. We selected the median employee based on the 63 full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal workers who were employed as of December31, 2017. We have no non-US employees. The 2017 annual total compensation as determined under Item402 of RegulationS-K for our Chief Executive Officer was $4,389,648. The 2017 annual total compensation as determined under Item402 of RegulationS-K for our median employee was $129,355.

      "Pay Ratio xFEFF Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. To identify the median employee, we identified our total employee population as of December15, 2017, and, in accordance with SEC rules, excluded the CEO, and employees from China representing in aggregate less than 5% of our employee base, to arrive at the median employee consideration pool. As of December15, 2017, we had 351 U.S. employees and 1,728 non U.S. employees, all of which were counted for purposes of calculating a de minimis exception under Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. There were 22 employees from China, all of whom were excluded from the calculation of the ratio in accordance with the de minimis exception outlined in Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. xFEFF Out of our median employee consideration pool, we identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total gross wages for all individuals (excluding our CEO and the employees from China) who were employed by us on December15, 2017. The median employee is employed as a Fitting Technician at our Lifestyle facility in Puerto Rico. After the median employee was identified, the employeex2019s annual total compensation for 2017 was determined for purposes of this disclosure. We calculated annual total compensation for the median employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement. xFEFF In accordance with the instructions to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we compared the median employeex2019s compensation to Mr. J. Brooksx2019 compensation, who was appointed our CEO on May18, 2017 and was our CEO on December15, 2017, the date we used to identify the median employee. Our median employeex2019s annual total compensation for 2017 was $9,935. As a result, we estimate that Mr. J. Brooksx2019 2017 annual total compensation was approximately 24 times that of our median employee. xFEFF Compensation of Directors for Fiscal Year 2017 xFEFF During 2017, the Company compensated each non-employee director as follows: xFEFF xB7 An annual retainer of $70,000, payable by the issuance of shares valued at $7,000 on the first day of each quarter (valued at the last closing price prior to such date), which shares are fully vested at issuance but restricted as to sale until December31, and the balance of $42,000 payable in cash quarterly (Mr. M. Brooks receives the entirety of his annual retainer of $70,000 in cash payable quarterly) xFEFF xB7 An annual retainer of $20,000 for service as Chairman of the Board, payable in cash quarterly xFEFF xB7 An annual retainer of $12,000 for service as Chairman of the Audit Committee, payable in cash quarterly xFEFF xB7 An annual retainer of $9,000 for service as Chairman of the Compensation Committee, payable in cash quarterly xFEFF xB7 An annual retainer of $6,000 for service as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, payable in cash quarterly and xFEFF 43   xB7 Reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with Board or committee meetings. xFEFF In addition, the Company granted to each non-employee director serving as of January3, 2017, an option to purchase 2,000 shares of common stock, exercisable for five years at $11.55 per share. xFEFF The table below shows the compensation earned by the Companyx2019s directors during fiscal year 2017: xFEFF xFEFF xFEFF          Name  Fees earned or paid in cash ($)  Stock Awards ($) (1)  Option Awards ($)  Total ($)  Jason Brooks (2)  -  -  -  -  Mike Brooks (3)\n",

      "Pay Ratio  For the 2017 fiscal year, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. W.M. ldquoRustyrdquo Rush, our Chief Executive Officer (ldquoCEO Compensationrdquo), to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees other than our Chief Executive Officer (ldquoMedian Annual Compensationrdquo) was approximately 102 to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions summarized below. In this summary, we refer to the employee who received such Median Annual Compensation as the ldquoMedian Employee.rdquo For purposes of this disclosure, the date used to identify the Median Employee was December 31, 2017 (the ldquoDetermination Daterdquo).  CEO Compensation for purposes of this disclosure represents the total compensation reported for Mr. W.M. ldquoRustyrdquo Rush under the ldquoSummary Compensation Tablerdquo for the 2017 fiscal year. For purposes of this disclosure, Median Annual Compensation was $59,112, and was calculated by totaling for our Median Employee all applicable elements of compensation for the 2017 fiscal year in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.  To identify the Median Employee, we first determined our employee population as of the Determination Date. We had 6,688 employees, representing all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries as of the Determination Date. This number does not include any independent contractors or ldquoleasedrdquo workers, as permitted by the applicable SEC rules. We then measured compensation for the period beginning on January 1, 2017, and ending on December 31, 2017, for these employees. This compensation measurement was calculated by totaling, for each employee, gross taxable earnings, as reflected on all payroll earnings statements issued during 2017, but excluding any allowances for items that were considered business expense reimbursements, such as automobile or mobile phone allowances, and any other Company-related expenses that were reimbursed during 2017. A portion of our employee workforce (full-time and part-time) worked for less than the full fiscal year due to commencing employment after the beginning of the fiscal year. In determining the Median Employee, we annualized the compensation for such individuals. Once the Median Employee was identified, the Median Annual Compensation for such employee was calculated in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.  50 Table of Contents  Compensation Committee Report    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any of the Companyrsquos filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the following report of the Compensation Committee shall not be incorporated by reference into any such filings and shall not be deemed soliciting material or filed under such Acts.  The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this proxy statement. Based upon this review and these discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.  Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors James C. Underwood, Chairman Thomas A. Akin Raymond J. Chess Dr. Kennon H. Guglielmo  Director Compensation    The Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approves annual compensation for nonemployee directors. In approving nonemployee director compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the amount of time that directors spend in fulfilling their duties to the Company, as well as the skill level required of Board members. The Companyrsquos executive officers do not make recommendations regarding the compensation of Messrs. Akin, Underwood, Chess, Cary and Dr. Guglielmo.  The Companyrsquos 2017 nonemployee director compensation structure, described in more detail below, consisted of (a) cash compensation in the form of annual retainer(s) and (b) equity compensation in the form of stock awards of the Companyrsquos Class A Common Stock.  2017 Annual Retainer  The 2017 annual retainer was as follows:  9679 Each nonemployee director received an annual retainer of $85,000 for service on the Board of Directors  9679 The Chairman of the Compensation Committee and the Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee each received an additional annual retainer of $5,000 and  9679 The Chairman of the Audit Committee received an additional annual retainer of $15,000. n\n"

The Audit Committee discussed with management the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and the quality and acceptability of the accounting principles employed, including all critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes, the reasonableness of judgments made and the clarity of the disclosures included in the statements. The Audit Committee also reviewed our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2017 and its evaluations of our internal control over financial reporting with KPMG LLP, our independent auditors for fiscal 2017, who are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by AS 1301, 147Communications with Audit Committees,148 as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP mandated by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditors146 communications with the audit committee concerning independence, discussed with KPMG LLP its independence and considered whether the provision of non-audit services provided by KPMG LLP is compatible with maintaining KPMG LLP146s independence. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to our Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 20\n",

      "Pay Ratio  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company performed a calculation of its CEO to median employee pay ratio in accordance with Item 402(u) of SEC Regulation S-K. The Corporation identified the median employee by examining the 2017 total cash compensation for all employees, excluding the CEO, who were employed by the Company as of December 31, 2017. It included all employees, including those employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis, and did not annualize the compensation for any employees who were not employed by the Company for all of 2017. After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, the Company calculated the total compensation for the median employee using the same methodology used for the CEO and other named executive officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table included on page 14 of this Proxy Statement.  Using the methodology described above, the Company estimates that the 2017 annual total compensation of the CEO, Mark A. Klein, in the amount of $778,334 was approximately 15.9 times the median employeersquos 2017 annual total compensation of $48,907.  15   Agreements with Executive Officers  Employment Agreement  On January 22, 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Mark A. Klein (the ldquoAampR Employment Agreementrdquo). The AampR Employment Agreement supersedes Mr. Kleinrsquos Employment Agreement dated July 15, 2015.  Under the AampR Employment Agreement, Mr. Klein continues to be employed as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as the President of State Bank and will perform duties assigned to him from time to time by the Board. Mr. Klein must devote his full business time and attention to the Companyrsquos business, and he may not render services of a business, commercial or professional nature to any person or organization without the prior written consent of the Board (except for limited charitable, community and other activities that do not interfere with the performance of his duties and responsibilities under the AampR Employment Agreement).  The AampR Employment Agreement has a rolling term of 36 months. The initial term of the AampR Employment Agreement commenced on January 22, 2018 and continues for a period of 36 consecutive months thereafter. The term will be automatically extended for an additional 12-month period on each 12-month anniversary of the January 22, 2018 effective date unless the Company notifies Mr. Klein in writing to the contrary at least 90 days before the anniversary date.  During the term of the AampR Employment Agreement, Mr. Klein will be paid an annual base salary of $352,783, subject to annual increases approved by the Board in its sole discretion. Mr. Klein is also entitled to: (a) receive incentive bonuses from time to time as the Board, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate (b) receive or participate in health and life insurance coverages, disability programs, tax-qualified retirement plans, equity compensation programs, paid holidays, paid vacation, and other fringe benefits as the Company may provide from time to time to actively employed and similarly situated employees (subject to the Companyrsquos right at any time to discontinue or terminate any employee benefit plan) (c) receive reimbursement for all reasonable business expenses he incurs in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Company (d) use of a vehicle provided by the Company and (e) receive liability insurance coverage under any policies covering directors and officers of the Company.  If Mr. Kleinrsquos employment is terminated by the Board for ldquoCauserdquo (as defined in the AampR Employment Agreement) or by Mr. Klein without ldquoGood Reasonrdquo (as defined in the AampR Employment Agreement), the AampR Employment Agreement will terminate automatically and Mr. Klein will only be entitled to receive any accrued but unpaid base salary through the date of termination and any unreimbursed business expenses or other payments and benefits to which Mr. Klein is entitled under the employee benefit plans of the Company as of the date of termination (the ldquoAccrued Obligationsrdquo).  If Mr. Kleinrsquos employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by Mr. Klein with Good Reason (and such termination does not occur in connection with a Change of Control as described below), the Company will: (i) pay to Mr. Klein any Accrued Obligations (ii) continue to pay Mr. Klein his base salary in effect on the date of his termination of employment for 24 months following the date of his termination and (iii) pay to Mr. Klein a lump sum cash amount equal to 24 times the monthly COBRA premium for the group health, dental and vision insurance in which Mr. Kl\n"

      "Pay Ratio The Company analyzed the total annual compensation for all of its employees and the employees of its consolidated subsidiaries, other than our Chief Executive Officer, in order to identify the employee with the median total annual compensation. In making this determination, the Company examined only payroll records of individuals who were employed by the Company or one of its consolidated subsidiaries on December31, 2017. No cost of living adjustments were made to any such employee's compensation, but the Company did annualize the compensation of individuals who commenced employment after January1, 2017. After the median compensated employee was identified, that employee's total annual compensation for fiscal year 2017 was determined in the same manner as if such individual was a named executive officer for 2017 whose compensation was required to be determined in accordance with SEC rules and reported in our \"Summary Compensation Table\" on page16. Based on the foregoing, the total annual compensation of such employee, as determined in accordance with SEC rules, was $40,658.61. As provided in our Summary Compensation Table, the total annual compensation for our Chief Executive Officer for the 2017 fiscal year was $7,427,151, which was 182.7 times the total annual compensation of our median compensated employee for the 2017 fiscal year. The above figures were reported in accordance with SEC rules. However, the Company believes that a more accurate disclosure would exclude \"on-call\" employees who have no set work schedule and work only on an as-needed basis, which may be a few times a year. If these \"on-call\" employees were excluded from the determination of our median compensated employee for the 2017 fiscal year, the total annual compensation of our median compensated employee would be $53,218.63, resulting in a ratio of the total annual compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to such employee of 139.6. Because a significant amount of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation for 2017 was in the form of equity compensation, and only a very small number of our employees receive equity compensation, we thought it would be helpful to our stockholders to see how the above ratios are impacted by excluding equity compensation. Excluding equity compensation, the total annual compensation of our median compensated employee remains unchanged and the total annual compensation for our Chief Executive Officer would be $3,477,151, resulting in a ratio of 85.5 if \"on-call\" employees are included and a ratio of 65.3 if \"on-call\" employees are not included. 28 Table of Contents SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS The SEC's rules set forth standards as to what stockholder proposals are required to be included in a proxy statement. Any proposal of a stockholder intended to be included in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy/voting instruction card for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must comply with the proxy submission rules of the SEC. Pursuant to Rule14a-8 of the SEC's rules, any such stockholder proposal intended to be included in the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement must be received by the Company's Secretary at the address listed below no later than 120 calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the release of the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement, unless the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is changed by more than 30days from the date of the 2018 Annual Meeting, in which case the deadline is a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and send proxy materials. In order to be included in the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule14a-8, any stockholder proposal must be received by the Secretary at the address listed below by November7, 2018, which is 120days prior to the anniversary date of the release of the 2018 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement. In addition, the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws require that the Company be given advanced notice of stockholder proposals containing nominations for election to the Board of Directors or other matters which stockholders wish to present for action at an annual meeting.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure  As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Russell A. Childs, the Chief Executive (the x201CCEOx201D). The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.  For 2017, our last completed fiscal year: xB7 the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than the CEO) was 49  Table of Contents $37,250 and xB7 the annual total compensation of the CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, was $2,857,395.  Based on this information, for 2017, the ratio of the median of the total compensation of all employees of the Company to the annual total compensation of Mr. Childs, the CEO, was 1 to 77. Determining the Median Employee.The Company determined that, as of December 31, 2017, the employee population consisted of approximately 18,000 individuals. The employee workforce consists of full and part time employees. For purposes of measuring the compensation of the employees, the Company selected total annual cash compensation for 2017 as the most appropriate measure of compensation, which was consistently applied to all the employees included in the calculation. With respect to the total annual compensation of the x201Cmedian employee,x201D the Company identified and calculated the elements of such employeex2019s compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in the annual total compensation reflected above.   50  Table of Contents CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS Transaction with Related Party During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company purchased $198,000 of spare aircraft parts from NORDAM, an entity affiliated with Meredith S. Madden, a director of the Company. Review and Approval of Transactions with Related Parties The Company believes that transactions between the Company and its directors and executive officers, or between the Company and persons related to directors and executive officers of the Company, present a heightened risk of creating or appearing to create a conflict of interest. Accordingly, the Company has adopted a policy regarding related8209party transactions that has been approved by the Board and incorporated into the Charter of the Audit Committee. The policy provides that the Audit Committee will review all transactions between the Company and related persons (as defined in Item404 of RegulationS8209K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission) for potential conflicts of interest. Under the Companyx2019s policy, all transactions between the Company and related persons are required to be submitted to the Audit Committee for approval prior to the Companyx2019s entry or participation in such transactions. 51  Table of Contents DIRECTOR COMPENSATION The Company uses a combination of cash and stock8209based incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve as directors. In setting director compensation, the Company considers the significant amount of time that directors expend in fulfilling their duties to the Company, as well as the skill level required by the Company of its directors. Cash Compensation Paid to Directors For the year ended December31, 2017, all directors who were not employees of the Company received an annual cash retainer of $80,000. The Chairman of the Audit Committee was paid an annual fee of $20,000, the Chairman of the Compensation Committee was paid an annual fee of $10,000, the Chairman of Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee was paid an annual fee of $5,000, the Chairman of the Safety and Compliance Committee was paid an annual fee of $5,000 and the Lead Independent Director was paid an annual fee of $20,000. The members of the Audit Committee were paidan annual fee of $4,000. The Chairman of the Board was paid an annual fee of $280,000. Russell A.

      "Pay Ratio Pursuant to Item402(u) of Regulation S-K, we have prepared a comparison of the annual total compensation of Mr.B. Scott Smith, our Chief Executive Officer and President, for fiscal year 2017 to the median of annual total compensation of all other Company employees for the same period. We identified the median employee for this review by examining the 2017 annual total compensation for all employees, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on December31, 2017 since it allowed us to make the identification in a reasonably efficient manner. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to annual total compensation, and we did not annualize the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2017. For this purpose and using reasonable estimates, the calculation of annual total compensation of all employees, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, was determined by using the wages and compensation reported in Box1 of FormW-2 for 2017. We selected W-2 compensation as our compensation measure because it is readily available in our existing payroll system, it is determined on a consistent basis for each employee, and because we believe it is a reasonable proxy for total compensation for purposes of determining the median employee. For the total annual compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, we used the 147Total Compensation148 shown for Mr.B. Scott Smith in the 147Summary Compensation Table148 on page34 of this Proxy Statement. Following our review, we have determined that for 2017:   149  the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than our Chief Executive Officer) was $52,400 and   149  the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page34 of this Proxy Statement, was $3,853,213.  43 Table of Contents Based on this information, for 2017, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr.B. Scott Smith, our Chief Executive Officer and President, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 73.5to1.0. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules and methods for disclosure. Due to estimates and assumptions as well as adjustments and statistical sampling permitted under the SEC rules, pay ratio disclosures may involve a degree of imprecision and our approach may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control The Named Executive Officers would receive certain payments and/or benefits upon termination from Sonic that would vary in amount depending on the reason for termination of employment. The Named Executive Officers also would receive certain payments and/or benefits in connection with a change in control of Sonic (including a termination of employment due to a change in control). The information below generally describes these payments and benefits. Payments and benefits under other plans and arrangements that are generally available to Sonic146s salaried employees on similar terms are not described. Payments Upon Termination Based on the compensation arrangements described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement and the terms of the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan, the estimated present value of the salary, bonus and stock award payments the Named Executive Officers could have received upon termination without cause as of December31, 2017 are as follows:  Name  Salary andBonus($)   StockAwards($)(1)(2)  O. Bruton Smith  $151   $3,558,433  B. Scott Smith  $151   $3,073,512  David Bruton Smith  $151   $2,090,348  Jeff Dyke  $151   $5,921,823  Heath R.

Because all employees are located in the United States, we did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the median employee.  Once the median employee was identified, we combined all of the elements of such employee146s compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x)of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, resulting in median employee total annual compensation of $189,830. Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies.  43 Table of Contents  POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL  Employment Agreements  We enter into employment agreements with each of the named executive officers.

      "Pay Ratio The median of the annual compensation paid by the Company during fiscal year 2017 to all employees as of December 31, 2017, is estimated to be approximately $31,667 (referred to as the 82202017 Median Compensation8221). The ratio of the 2017 Median Compensation to the annual compensation paid by the Company to Eric P. Sills, our Chief Executive Officer and President, during fiscal year 2017, which is described in the Summary Compensation Table for 2017 above, is estimated to be one to thirty-five. 160 45 Table of Contents We identified our median employee using payroll records that reflect total wages and other compensation paid to our employees during fiscal year 2017, as reported to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 and the equivalent for our non-U.S. employees. Adjustments were made to annualize the compensation of all permanent employees (full-time or part-time) who were employed for less than the full fiscal year, and to convert to U.S. dollars any compensation paid to our employees in currencies other than U.S. dollars using the relevant exchange rate at year-end. The resulting ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Severance and Change of Control Arrangements Severance Compensation Agreement In December 2001, we entered into a Severance Compensation Agreement with James J. Burke. Mr. Burke8217s Severance Compensation Agreement provides that if a change in control of the Company occurs and, within 12 months thereafter, Mr. Burke8217s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Burke for certain specific reasons, then he will receive severance payments and certain other benefits. The specific reasons which allow Mr. Burke to resign and receive the benefits are: (1) a reduction or change in status, position or reporting responsibility (2) a reduction in his annual rate of base salary and (3) relocation of more than 15 miles from the Company8217s current office. If Mr. Burke resigns for one of the specific reasons, or is terminated without cause, he will be entitled to receive: (1) a severance payment equal to three times his base salary plus standard bonus, payable over a two year period on a pro rata, semi-monthly basis (2) continued participation for a period of 36 months in group medical, dental and/or life insurance plans (3) exclusive use of a company automobile for the duration of the lease then in effect and (4) outplacement services. For purposes of the agreement, a change in control of the Company means the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person or group other than certain designated individuals or (2) any person or group, other than certain designated individuals, become the beneficial owner or owners of more than 50% of the total voting stock of the Company, including by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise. Retention Bonus and Insurance Agreements In December 2006, the Company entered into a Retention Bonus and Insurance Agreement with James J. Burke, which agreement provides, among other things, that (1) Mr. Burke will remain an employee of the Company for a term of not less than three additional years after he reaches the age of 60 (the 8220Extension Period8221) (2) Mr. Burke will receive additional compensation comprised of one year8217s salary plus any applicable bonus at par payable in a lump sum and (3) Mr. Burke will receive an extension of his life insurance policy during the Extension Period. The additional compensation payable under such agreement would be forfeited in the event that Mr. Burke8217s employment is terminated for any reason, other than a disability, in which case Mr. Burke would be entitled to a pro rata bonus calculated as provided in the agreement. 160 46 Table of Contents Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) The Company has established a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for our executive officers and other eligible employees. The purpose of this plan is to enable the Company to supplement the benefits under the Company8217s Profit Sharing 401(K) Capital Accumulation Plan as well as to provide a means whereby certain amounts payable by the Company to our executive officers may be deferred to some future period. To the extent that an eligible employee retires or is terminated, their accounts in the SERP shall be paid either in a lump sum or over a period of time, at the election of the employee.

Quinn Stepan, Jr., the Company8217s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.We consider the pay ratio specified below to be a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with the requirements of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017:  x2022 The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company, except the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, was $105,414  x2022 The annual total compensation of the Company8217s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was $3,694,371 and  x2022 The ratio of the median of the annual total compensation of all Company employees, other than the Company8217s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to the annual total compensation of the Company8217s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was approximately 1 to 35. The Company chose December 31, 2017 as the date for determining the employee population used to identify the median employee.The Company identified the median employee using the base salaries of all employees globally, converting local currency non-U.S. base salaries into U.S. dollars using December 29, 2017 exchange rates.Permanent employees who joined in 2017 and permanent employees who were on leave during 2017 were assumed to have worked for the entire year.The Company used base salaries to identify the median employee because the Company does not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees and because this measure approximately reflects the total annual compensation of employees.The Company calculated the median employee8217s and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer8217s annual total compensation consistent with the disclosure requirements for the Summary Compensation Table.For purposes of this calculation, the median employee8217s annual total compensation consisted of wages, premium pay (including overtime, holiday pay and shift differential), paid time off, non-equity incentive plan compensation, change in pension value and retirement plan contributions.  31  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION Overview of Director Compensation Program The Company uses a combination of cash and stock-based incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on the Board of Directors. The Compensation and Development Committee annually reviews the adequacy and competitiveness of the amount of the annual retainer fee, Board committee chairmen fees, and stock awards, and makes adjustments as it deems appropriate. Directors8217 Fees For the fiscal year ended December16031, 2017, Directors who were not also employees of the Company (8220Non-Employee Directors8221) were paid an annual retainer fee (8220Annual Director Retainer Fee8221) of $80,000. The Lead Independent Director was paid an additional annual fee of $15,000, the Chairman of the Audit Committee was paid an additional annual fee of $20,000, the Chairman of the Compensation and Development Committee was paid an additional annual fee of $15,000, and the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee was paid an additional annual fee of $10,000. No fees or other compensation for service as a Director were paid to Directors who were also employees of the Company. Directors Deferred Compensation Plan A Non-Employee Director may defer receipt of his Director compensation into one or more available investment options offered under the Stepan Company Directors Deferred Compensation Plan (as amended and restated as of January1601, 2012). At the election of a Non-Employee Director, deferred payments generally may be made in shares of Common Stock or cash, depending upon the election made by the Non-Employee Director. Stock Awards and Incentive Compensation Program for Non-Employee Directors Pursuant to the 2011 Incentive Plan and upon the terms and conditions as determined by the Compensation and Development Committee, each Non-Employee Director serving as a Director of the Company on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders each year will be awarded an annual stock award (8220Annual Stock Award8221). At the Non-Employee Director8217s election, the Annual Stock Award is either delivered at the time of the grant or deferred. For 2017, each Non-Employee Director serving as a Director of the Company on April 25, 2017 received an Annual Stock Award of 1,044 shares of Common Stock. The number of shares was determined by dividing $90,000 by $86.16, the average of the opening and closing prices of Common Sto\n"

      "Pay Ratio In accordance with Item 402(u) of SEC Regulation S-K, we have calculated our CEO pay ratio for our 2018 fiscal year. The Company and its subsidiaries have worldwide operations and employ approximately 11,800 people in 33 countries, with approximately 7,200 of our employees in the United States and 4,600 outside the United States. Measurement Date Our median employee was identified from the population of all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (other than the CEO) as of January1, 2018, as described below. In identifying the median employee, we did not exclude persons who became employees by virtue of acquisitions during the year. De Minimis Exception We are permitted to exclude employees outside the United States so long as the total number of excluded employees does not exceed 5% of the total Company group employee population. The decision regarding which employee populations to exclude was based primarily upon size of the local workforce. As a result, we gathered information from the following countries, which had a total workforce of approximately 11,270, or more than 95%, of our total employee population:   Brazil    France    Mexico   Canada    Ireland    Netherlands   China    Italy    United Kingdom   Finland    Malaysia    United States  The following countries, which had a total workforce of 531 and a per country workforce as noted, were excluded:   Australia       2       India       24       Slovenia       24      Austria       2       Japan       5       South Africa       23      Belgium       7       Jordan       1       Spain       50      Costa Rica       74       Russian Federation       1       Switzerland       23      Czech Republic       46       Saudi Arabia       2       Thailand       66      Germany       135       Singapore       26       Turkey       1      Greece       1       Slovakia       15       United Arab Emirates       3     Consistently Applied Compensation Measure (147CACM148) As permitted by the regulations, which allow the median employee to be determined based upon any consistently applied compensation measure, we used federal taxable earnings (generally base wages, overtime pay, and cash bonuses and incentives) as reported by the relevant payroll processing systems for calendar year 2017 as our CACM. Earnings were translated to the U.S. dollar equivalent based upon average exchange rates in effect during calendar year 2017. We endeavored to exclude all employees whose employment terminated before January1, 2018 and their compensation and were able to do so with respect to most of the employee groups, including our  68Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and 2018 Proxy Statement Table of Contents  ExecutiveCompensation:CEOPayRatio   largest employee bases in the United States and United Kingdom.

      "Pay Ratio The following is a reasonable estimate, prepared under applicable SEC rules, of the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr.Armstrong, our chief executive officer, to the median of the annual total compensation of our other employees. As required by the SEC rules, we included in our employee population as of the determination date all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees. We determined our median employee based on W-2 earnings for 2017 of each of our 129 employees (excluding the chief executive officer) as of December31, 2017. We determined that the median employee was a part-time, hourly employee, whose annual total compensation for 2017 was $3,793. As disclosed in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table appearing on page33, Mr.Armstrong146s annual total compensation for 2017 was $1,719,727. Based on the foregoing, our estimate of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was 453to 1. A significant majority of our employees are part-time or temporary hourly employees who service our entertainment operations at ACL Live. Specifically, of our 129 employees as of December31, 2017, 85 (or approximately 66%) were temporary or part-time employees who worked less than 30 hours per week and/or who did not work every week. If we had excluded these employees from our employee population as of December31, 2017 and evaluated our 44 full-time employees as of that date, the annual total compensation of our median employee for 2017 would have been $81,827, resulting in an estimated ratio of 21to 1. Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies.  40 Table of Contents Proposal No.2: Advisory Vote on the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the 147Dodd-Frank Act148), enacted in July 2010, requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with Section14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This vote (commonly referred to as a 147say-on-pay148 vote) is advisory, which means that it is not binding on the company, the board of directors or the compensation committee of the board of directors. However, our board and the compensation committee value the opinion of our stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when evaluating our executive compensation program. The vote is not intended to address any specific compensation arrangement or amount, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and our compensation philosophy and practices as disclosed under the 147Executive Officer Compensation148 section of this proxy statement. This disclosure includes the compensation tables and narrative discussion following the compensation tables. At last year146s annual meeting, we provided our stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote regarding the compensation of our named executive officers, and our stockholders approved the 147say-on-pay148 proposal, with approximately 97.2% of the total votes cast voting for the proposal. This year we are again asking our stockholders to vote on the following resolution: RESOLVED, That the stockholders of Stratus Properties Inc. (the 147Company148) approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company146s named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company146s proxy statement for the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We understand that our executive compensation practices are important to our stockholders. Our core executive compensation philosophy continues to be based on pay for performance, and we believe that our executive compensation program is strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders, as more fully discussed in 147Executive Officer Compensation151Compensation Discussion and Analysis.148   In considering how to vote on this proposal, we encourage you to review the relevant disclosures in this proxy statement, especially the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which contains detailed information about the recent changes to our executive compensation program. Although this advisory vote is not binding, our board and the compensation committee value the opinion of our stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when evaluating our executive compensation program.

Previous Say on Pay and Shareholder Engagement The Board and Compensation Committee are committed to the concept of pay-for-performance. Consequently, our executive compensation programs are designed to reward achievement and over-achievement of goals, and to penalize performance shortfalls. At the 2017 Annual and Special Meeting of the Shareholders, approximately 97.0% of the shares voted were in favor of the advisory resolution to support executive compensation, an increase from the 81.1% of shares that voted in favor of this resolution at the 2016 Annual and Special Meeting. This increase in support reflects the Company146s efforts to increase alignment between shareholder returns and management compensation following conversations with shareholders. Compensation Practices The Compensation Committee utilizes best practices in governing our executive compensation programs. Therefore, there are certain things that we do and do not do, as a matter of practice: What we DO What we DO NOT do 9632 Tie executives146 pay to results achieved by weighting variable pay heavily in our pay mix 9632 Provide change-in-control severance payments exceeding market norms 9632 Use equity to drive a long-term perspective aligned with shareholders 9632 Allow stock option repricing or discounted stock option granting 9632 Promote stock ownership with competitive stock ownership guidelines 9632 Offer change-in-control tax gross-ups under any circumstances 9632 Consider shareholder perspectives in our program designs 9632 Pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned or unvested performance shares 9632 Maintain a clawback policy which meets or exceeds regulatory requirements 9632 Allow our executives or directors to hedge or pledge company stock 9632 Use double-trigger change in control provisions for all non pro rata payouts under cash and equity incentive plans* 9632 Maintain a cap on our short-term incentive payout  9632 Assess our pay-for-performance relationship and conduct a compensation risk assessment annually  *Note: Some employment agreements entered into prior to 2016 and other agreements prior to 2017 contain single-trigger change-in-control provisions. Compensation Philosophy Our executive compensation philosophy and the policies that support it are intended to reward our executives for the achievement of long-term strategic goals and their efforts to enhance shareholder value. The philosophy fosters a performance-oriented environment that rewards achievement of internal Company goals and shareholder value creation. Our pay-for-performance philosophy is based on these objectives: If you have any questions or need assistance completing your proxy or voting instruction form, please call Kingsdale Advisors at 1-877-659-1822 or email at contactus@kingsdalesadvisors.com. 43 Compensation opportunities provided to executives are intended to approximate market median pay levels, assuming the targeted level of performance is delivered. Performance targets are generally set in relation to the Company146s internal budget goals. Then, using the target as the starting point, upside and downside payout ranges around the target are developed. These ranges provide additional compensation opportunity to executives if results exceed targets, while penalizing under-performance. Through this design, our executive compensation program motivates our team, while delivering true 145pay-for-performance146 from a shareholder perspective.  CEO Transition Katrina (Kathy) Houde began fiscal 2017 as the Interim CEO. She was tasked by the Board of Directors to lead the initial stages of the Value Creation Plan to accelerate the growth and profitability of the business. Ms. Houde146s service as Interim CEO ended on February 6,\n"

This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.232017 Grants of Plan-Based AwardsNameGrant DateCommittee Action Date (1)Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards (2)Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards (3)All Other Stock Awards: Number of Shares of Stock or Units () (4)Grant Date Fair Value of Stock and Option Awards (5)160160160ThresholdTargetMaximumThresholdTargetMaximum160160(a)(b)160(c)(d)(e)(f)(g)(h)(k)(l)Craig C.

For a discussion of these performance goals, see our CDampA section included in this proxy statement. The Committee targeted a payout equal to 65% of salary for each of the NEOs, which would be achieved if 100% of the Performance Metric goal and 80% of the strategic goals were met. Consequently, the target amounts in this column assume that the NEOs earned 65% of the maximum potential awards that they could have earned using these annual incentive opportunities. The threshold amounts assume that the NEOs earned the minimum cash incentive awards based on performance required to trigger any level of payout. If Company performance fell below performance goals required to earn the threshold amount, they would not have been entitled to any non-equity incentive plan awards. Mr. Bram earned 61.6%, Mr. Loughran earned 62.4%, Mr. Pennington earned 73.2%, and Mr. Gibson earned 16.1% of these non-equity incentive plan awards based on our performance during 2017. These annual incentive amounts are also included under 8220Non-Equity Incentive Compensation8221 in the Summary Compensation Table.(3) These amounts represent grants of performance-vesting restricted stock made pursuant to our 2017 Incentive Plan. These restricted shares will be earned over the performance cycle ending December 31, 2019. For a discussion of the other material terms of these awards, see our CDampA section. The Committee targeted a payout of restricted shares equivalent to 32.5% of base salary for Mr. Bram and 22.5% of base for the other NEOs.

We used the compensation components utilized in the Summary Compensation Table / page 36 of this proxy statement32(8220SCT8221) for the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 as the compensation measure to identify the median employee, and the median employee8217s compensation.

Total Annual Compensation for Fiscal Year 2017  Name  Total AnnualCompensation ($)  Mr.Kesseler   4,454,468  Median Employee(1)   47,758  Ratio   93.27 to 1    (1) The Median Employee is paid in Euros. Compensation has been converted to U.S. Dollars based on an average exchange rate from Euro to U.S.Dollar of 1.13935/1. Employees Covered The median employee was identified based on full- and part-time employees active at our company worldwide on October31, 2017 based on compensation paid for the period from November1, 2016 through October31, 2017. Seasonal employees who were not active employees on October31, 2017, and individuals employed by third parties who work at our facilities were not included.  61 Table of Contents Methodology Employed to Determine the Median Employee We identified the median employee by examining the total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding Mr.Kesseler, employed by us on October31, 2017. Total cash compensation includes annual wages, overtime pay, variable pay bonuses, shift differentials, additional months pay (for individuals in some non-U.S. countries as required by law), pay for bereavement leave, military leave, jury duty, maternity/paternity leave and payments for unused vacation time in countries or U.S. states where applicable. For any employee (except temporary employees and interns) hired during the period from November1, 2016 to October31, 2017 who was an active employee on October31, 2017, the annual compensation of such individual was annualized. No cost of living adjustment was taken in determining the median employee. Methodology Employed to Determine Mr.Kesseler146s 2017 Compensation Mr.Kesseler became our Chief Executive Officer effective on May17, 2017.

      "Pay Ratio DisclosureAs a result of the recently adopted rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC requires disclosure of the CEO to median employee pay ratio. To determine our median employee, we prepared a list of all employees as of December 31, 2017 and calculated total cash compensation of our median employee for 2017 based on payroll data. We selected total cash compensation as a consistently applied compensation measure for all employees in part because all outstanding equity awards granted under the Company8217s Long-Term Incentive Plan vested in full at the effective time of the Merger and were converted into the right to receive the Merger consideration regardless of the grant date of the equity awards or their grant-date fair value. As of December 31, 2017, we had 119 employees. For purposes of this list, total cash compensation included salary, bonus, the value of RSUs that vested in 2017 (including RSUs that were converted into cash consideration at the effective time of the Merger) and the special dividend paid to RSU holders at the effective time of the Merger. Wages and salaries were annualized for permanent employees that were not employed for the full year of 2017. Our median employee had 2017 total cash compensation of $151,592.32Our CEO as of December 31, 2017, Mr. Stinebaugh, is employed by our controlling stockholder, Brookfield, and provides services to the Company under a management services agreement. Mr. Stinebaugh does not receive any direct compensation from the Company for his services as our CEO as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. As such, a ratio of CEO total compensation to our median employee8217s total compensation would not be meaningful and is not presented.Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.The following table sets forth certain information known to us regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities as of March 31, 2018 by:8226each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities 8226each of our directors 8226each of our named executive officers and 268226all executive officers and directors as a group. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. Except as noted by footnote below, and subject to community property laws where applicable, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them.

In addition, we are required to report in 8220Executive Compensation82122017 Option Exercises and Stock Vested8221 below an amount for the 8220value realized8221 upon: (i)160any exercise by Mr.160Musk of a stock option, which is based on the difference between the market price of the underlying shares at the time of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option, and (ii)160any vesting of a restricted stock unit award, based on the market price of the award at the time of vesting. Such amount is required to be reported even if Mr.160Musk does not actually receive any cash from such exercise or vesting, either because he does not also sell any shares or because he sells only a number of shares sufficient to cover the related tax liabilities resulting from the exercise or vesting. As a result, there may be a significant disconnect between what is reported as compensation for Mr. Musk in a given year in such sections and the value actually realized as compensation in that year or over a period of time. Moreover, the vast majority of compensation in respect of past stock option grants to Mr.160Musk, including the 2012 CEO Performance Award and the 2018 CEO Performance Award, were incentives for future performance and their value is realizable only if the Company8217s stock price appreciates compared to the dates of the grants, and the Company achieves applicable vesting requirements.

      "PAY RATIO  For 2017, the total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer of $2,983,955, as presented in the Summary Compensation Table, was approximately 29 times the total compensation of our median employee of $104,675. To identify the median of the annual compensation of all of our employees (other than the CEO), we used wages from our payroll records as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for fiscal year 2017 and added the fair value of options granted in 2017. The median employee was identified by reviewing the total compensation for all employees (other than the CEO) who were employed by us on December 31, 2017. All of our employees were included, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis. Adjustments were made to annualize the compensation of employees who were not employed by us for the entire year. No full-time equivalent adjustments were made for part time employees.  The SECrsquospay ratiodisclosure rules provide reporting companies with a great deal of flexibility in determining the methodology used to identify the median employee and thepay ratio. As such, our methodology may differ materially from the methodology used by other companies to prepare theirpay ratiodisclosures, which may contribute to a lack of comparability between ourpay ratioand thepay ratioreported by other companies, including those within our industry.

      "Pay Ratio DisclosureAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the Company is providing the following information regarding the ratio of the total annual compensation for the Company's Global Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to the median of the annual total compensation of all Company employees (other than the Company8217s Global Chief Executive Officer).For purposes of calculating the 2017 ratio of the median annual total compensation of all Company employees to the total annual compensation of the Company8217s Global CEO, the Company included in its calculation of compensation: base salary, commissions, annual bonus amounts, stock-based compensation (based on the grant date fair value of awards granted during 2017) and other incentive payments. The Company used December 31, 2017 as its measurement date. Total compensation for Mr. Holger Bartel, the Company8217s Global CEO was determined to be $1,474,945 and was approximately 25 times the median annual compensation of all Company employees, excluding the Global CEO, of $59,663.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure Mr. Amato, our CEO, had 2017 total compensation of $3,424,722, as reflected in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table. We estimate that the median of 2017 total compensation for all employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 (the 147Determination Date148), excluding our CEO, was $35,730, which amount comprises all applicable elements of compensation for 2017 in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K (the 147Median Annual Compensation148). The ratio of Mr. Amato146s 2017 total compensation to the Median Annual Compensation was approximately ninety-six to one. We note that, due to our permitted use of reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing this pay ratio disclosure, the disclosure may involve a degree of imprecision, and thus this ratio disclosure is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions described below. To identify the employee who received the Median Annual Compensation (the 147Median Employee148), we measured annual base pay (consisting of regular base earnings and overtime) for the period beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2017 for 4,013 employees, representing all full-time, part-time, seasonal, temporary and contract employees (whose compensation is determined by the Company) of the Company and our consolidated subsidiaries as of the Determination Date. In determining the Median Employee, we also annualized compensation for employees who worked less than all of 2017 (other than temporary employees) based on reasonable assumptions and estimates relating to our employee compensation program, including new hires. 2018 Proxy Statement I 47 TABLE OF CONTENTS TriMas Corporation ADDITIONAL INFORMATION What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting? At the Annual Meeting, holders of the Company146s Common Stock will act upon the matters outlined in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting, including: to elect three directors to serve until the annual meeting in 2021 to ratify the appointment of Deloitte as the Company146s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company146s NEOs and to transact such other business as may properly come before the meeting. In addition, management will report on the performance of the Company and will respond to appropriate questions from shareholders. Who is entitled to vote? The Company146s Common Stock constitutes the Voting Stock of the Company. As of March 13, 2018 (the 147Record Date148), there were no outstanding shares of preferred stock of the Company. Only record holders of Common Stock at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to receive notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote those shares of Common Stock that they held on the Record Date. Each outstanding share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. What constitutes a quorum? For business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting, a quorum must be present. The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the Record Date will constitute a quorum for all purposes. As of the Record Date, 45,926,794 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. Broker non-votes and proxies marked with abstentions or instructions to withhold votes will be counted as present in determining whether there is a quorum. What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and being a beneficial owner? Shareholders of Record. If, at the close of business on the Record Date, your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company146s transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares, and these proxy materials (including a proxy card) are being sent directly to you by the Company. As a shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the Company through the enclosed proxy card or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Beneficial Owners. If, at the close of business on the Record Date, your shares were not issued directly in your name, but were held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, trustee or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares, and these proxy materials (including a voting instruction card) are being forwarded to you by your broker, trustee, bank or nominee who is considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure For 2017, the ratio of the total compensation of Trustmark146s median employee to the CEO146s total compensation was 1 to 60. To calculate this ratio, Trustmark identified its median employee as of December31, 2017 based on employees146 gross earnings, less before-tax benefit deductions, as reported in Box 5 of the United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-2. Compensation was annualized for employees who worked less than a full year, and compensation for part-time employees was annualized but not converted into a full-time equivalent. Once identified, the median employee146s total compensation for 2017 was determined in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K to be $43,000, as compared to total compensation of $2,600,000 for Trustmark146s CEO. Human Resources Committee Report The Human Resources Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K, and based on such review and discussions, the Human Resources Committee, as listed below, recommended to the Auditamp Finance Committee, acting on behalf of the Board, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.  John M. McCullouch (Chairman)  Richard H. Puckett Adolphus B. Baker  R. Michael Summerford Human Resources Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The following directors served on Trustmark146s Human Resources Committee during 2017: John M. McCullouch (Chairman), Adolphus B. Baker, Daniel A. Grafton (January 1 150 April 25), Richard H. Puckett and R. Michael Summerford. No current or former executive officer or associate of Trustmark or any of its subsidiaries currently serves or has served as a member of the Human Resources Committee or has been involved in any related party transaction as discussed in the section beginning on page 38. Employment and Change in Control Agreements with NEOs Employment Agreement with Mr. Host. In connection with his election as President and CEO of Trustmark Corporation and the Bank, Trustmark and Mr.Host entered into a new employment agreement, effective January1, 2011 (the Agreement), to replace his prior 2007 agreement. If not terminated earlier, Mr.Host146s employment under the Agreement will automatically terminate upon his retirement on December31, 2019, the year he turns 65. Either Trustmark or Mr.Host may terminate Mr.Host146s employment with 30 days146 notice, except that no prior notice is required in the case of termination for Cause. Mr.Host is guaranteed a minimum base salary of $550,000 annually, subject to annual review. Recognizing the need to be flexible in the current economic environment, the Agreement provides that Mr.Host146s base salary may be reduced below $550,000, with his consent, if Trustmark reduces the base salaries of other senior executives. Mr.Host is eligible to earn an annual cash bonus, with a bonus target amount of 70% of his base salary. Mr.Host is also eligible to receive equity compensation awards on such basis as the Committee determines and is eligible to participate in any benefit plans or programs that are offered to senior executives generally. On any cessation of employment, Mr.Host will be entitled to his earned but unpaid base salary and annual bonus and, except in the case of termination for Cause, any accrued vacation (earned compensation).

      "PAY RATIO Under Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402 of Regulation S-K, under the Securities Act (147Item 402148), the company is required to disclose (i)the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the company (except the CEO), (ii) the annual total compensation of the CEO, and (iii)the ratio of the median of the total compensation of all employees of the company to the annual total compensation of the CEO (the 147Pay Ratio Disclosure148). In order to identify the median employee, the total taxable compensation in 2017 of all employees globally, including those employed on a full-time, part-time, seasonal or temporary basis by the company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries, was collected as of December31, 2017, and then converted into U.S. dollars and annualized for those employees who were not employed for the entire 2017 fiscal year. The total taxable compensation was determined from information derived from tax and/or payroll records. We then selected an employee that was one spot above the median employee that was identified, as such employee146s annual total compensation was more representative of the annual total compensation of our employee base (the originally identified median employee received a new hire equity grant that would have inflated annual total compensation because the full value of the grant would have been required to be included as part of their total annual compensation under Item 402 even though the employee actually only received 1/4th of that value in 2017 as a result of vesting conditions). Using this methodology, it was determined that, for 2017, the median employee was an exempt, full-time employee located in the U.S. Our CEO, Mr.Dorsey had annual total compensation for 2017, calculated using the requirements of Item 402 for purposes of the Pay Ratio Disclosure, of $0.00 because Mr.Dorsey declined all compensation during 2017. The annual total compensation of the median employee of the company for 2017, calculated using the same requirements under Item 402 for purposes of the Pay Ratio Disclosure, which included base pay, incentive compensation, the grant date fair value of equity grants and the company146s matching contribution to that employee146s 401(k) plan, was $161,860. Accordingly, the ratio of the annual total compensation of the CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the company (except the CEO) was 0. The Pay Ratio Disclosure presented above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402. Because the SEC146s final regulations for identifying the median employee, calculating annual total compensation and determining the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies, exemptions, estimates and assumptions, the company146s Pay Ratio Disclosure may not be comparable to that reported by other companies.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE  In August2015, the SEC issued final rulesimplementing the provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that require U.S. publicly-traded companies to disclose the ratio of their chief executive officer146s compensation to that of their median employee. Disclosure pursuant to such rulesis not included herein because the company does not have any employees.  PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE RELATING TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  The SEC adopted rulespursuant to Section951 of the Dodd-Frank Act that require public companies to provide stockholders with periodic advisory (non-binding) votes on executive compensation, also referred to as 147say-on-pay148 proposals.  As more fully described under the sections of this proxy statement entitled 147Executive Officers148 and 147Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,148 we are externally managed by PRCM Advisors pursuant to the Management Agreement between us and PRCM Advisers and, consequently, we do not have any employees and have not paid any cash compensation directly to any of our named executive officers. Each named executive officer146s compensation is comprised of cash compensation paid to them directly by the parent company of our external manager, Pine River, and equity awards granted by our  44 Table of Contents  company pursuant to our Equity Incentive Plan. The amount of cash compensation paid to each named executive officer is determined by and is the responsibility of Pine River and the amount of the equity awards granted to each named executive officer is determined by our Compensation Committee. For more information regarding our executive compensation, please see 147Executive Officers148 above.  At the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, we provided our stockholders with an opportunity to cast an advisory vote regarding our executive compensation. At that meeting, the stockholders approved the proposal, with approximately 96% of the votes cast voting in favor of the proposal.  Similar to last year, at the 2018 Annual Meeting, we are asking you to vote 147FOR148 the adoption of the following resolution:  147RESOLVED:That the stockholders of the company approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation paid to the company146s executive officers, as disclosed in the company146s proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rulesof the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related narrative discussions in the proxy statement.148  Because this say-on-pay vote is advisory in nature, it is not binding on us, our Board of Directors, our Compensation Committee, PRCM Advisers or Pine River. Our Board of Directors has determined that our company will hold an advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis. We currently expect to conduct our next advisory vote on executive compensation at our next annual meeting of stockholders in May2019.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE 147FOR148 THE ADVISORY VOTE RELATED TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.  PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  We are asking our stockholders to ratify the appointment of Ernstamp Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December31, 2018. Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, our Board of Directors is submitting the selection of Ernstamp Young LLP to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. In the event stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the appointment will be reconsidered by our Audit Committee. Even if the selection is ratified, our Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of our company. A representative of Ernstamp Young LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE 147FOR148 RATIFICATION OF ERNSTamp YOUNG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  45 Table of Contents  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT AND AUDITOR FEES  Audit Committee Report  The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Committee presently composed of independent directors Stephen G.

      "Pay RatioOur CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of the SEC's Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining the annual total compensation for all of our employees, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 31, 2017. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis. To determine the median employee, we calculated the total annual compensation for each of our 4,125 employees as the sum of the following amounts:8226Annual base pay8226The company's matching contributions to the employee's 401(k) account8226Calendar year cash bonus8226Calendar year stock option grants (incentive or nonqualified stock options)We believe the use of these components for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure that includes all of the compensation elements that are widely distributed throughout our organization, including retirement benefits. We calculated annual total compensation for the median employee using the same methodology we use for our Named Executive Officers as set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation table included in this proxy statement. The total annual compensation calculated for our CEO was $3,725,09232and for our median employee was $82,039. The resulting ratio for our CEO8217s pay compared with the pay of our median employee for 2017 is 45.4 to 1.38Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2017The following table sets forth certain information relating to grants of plan-based awards to the Named Executive Officers during 2017:160160160160Estimated160Future160PayoutsUnder160Non-160EquityIncentive160Plan160Awards160(1)160All160Other160OptionAwards:160Number160ofSecurities UnderlyingOptions()160(2)160Exercise160or160BasePrice160of160OptionAwards($/Sh)160Grant160Date160FairValue160of160StockandOption160Awards($)160(3)Name160GrantDate160Target($)160Maximum($)160160160John S.

These options will vest ratably over a three-year period beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date for each Named Executive Officer who is at least fifty years of age or older and has a tenure with the company of at least fifteen years or more. All options have a contractual term of ten years. The option terms are the same for substantially all the options granted to employees on June 1, 2017 and December 1, 2017 certain key employees who are closer to retirement age may, in the discretion of our Chief Executive Officer, receive shorter vesting periods.(3)The aggregate grant date fair value is determined in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Stock Compensation, and does not represent cash received by the Named Executive Officers in 2017. The grant date fair value represents potential earnings contingent on Tyler8217s future performance. Stock option grants are designed to provide long-term (up to ten years) incentives and rewards linked directly to the price of our common stock.

The Committee also met in July 2017 to review the results of the shareholder votes related to 147Say-on-Pay148 and the frequency of future advisory votes from the Annual Meeting of Shareholders and to discuss the Institutional Shareholder Services (147ISS148) Report. In addition, the Committee met in November 2017 to review the Annual Incentive Compensation Risk Assessment, and to review the Company146s Management Succession and Development Plan. Prior to the February 2017 Compensation Committee Meeting, the Chairman of the Company146s Compensation Committee and the Company146s Chief Executive Officer met to review the performance of the Company, the CEO146s performance, the performance of the other named executive officers, and the CEO146s recommendations as to the compensation of each named executive officer. The conclusions reached, and recommendations based on these reviews, including salary adjustments and annual award amounts, were presented to the Committee. The Committee, without the CEO present, annually reviews the CEO146s performance and reaches a recommendation as to his compensation. The Committee considered compensation information for the Peer Group (hereinafter defined) gathered from documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and publicly available executive compensation surveys. The Committee also reviews a summary compensation table which provides an overview of total compensation for each named executive officer. The summary compensation table includes the value of each component of compensation including base salary, annual cash incentive award, incentive equity awards, change in pension benefit value, change in non-qualified deferred compensation earnings, and other compensation. The Committee reviews the summary compensation table on an annual basis. Overview of Compensation Program The Company146s executive compensation program is designed to:   149  Retain executive officers by paying them competitively, motivating them to contribute to the Company146s success, and rewarding them for their performance.  23 Table of Contents  149  Link a substantial part of each executive officer146s compensation to the performance of both the Company and the individual executive officer.   149  Encourage ownership of Company common stock by executive officers.   149  Discourage excessive risk-taking by executive officers. 2017 Executive Compensation Components For the fiscal year ended December31, 2017, the principal components of compensation for named executive officers were:   149  Salary   149  Annual cash incentive compensation   149  Long-term incentive equity based compensation   149  Retirement and other benefits Role of Consultants, Peer Group, and Surveys The Company uses salary surveys and peer group information when evaluating the compensation of our named executive officers. Periodically, the Committee retains the services of nationally recognized compensation consulting firms to provide independent advice on compensation matters and to review the Company146s compensation program for all executive officers. The Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate any compensation consultant that assists with the Committee146s compensation analysis. The Committee receives comparative compensation data from management, proxy statements, other public disclosures or reports prepared by its independent compensation consultants providing insight on industry best practices. In 2014, the Committee retained McLagan, an Aon Hewitt company, to review UBSI146s Annual Cash Incentive Compensation program and compare the plan with those of its peers, industry best practices and regulatory guidance. In 2016, the Committee retained McLagan to recommend a new long-term incentive plan including prevalent designs, features and implications of various design alternatives. McLagan also conducted a peer group analysis. In 2017, the Committee retained McLagan to review the Company146s CEO pay ratio disclosure that is required by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K mandated by Section953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the 147CEO Pay Ratio148). Peer Group In determining executive compensation for 2017, the Committee used a peer group that consisted of banking companies operating in the United States in the same lines of business as United and of similar size (the 147Peer Group148). The Peer Group was refined in 2017 to account for recent consolidation throughout the industry.

Miller, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  As is permitted under the SEC rules, we reasonably determined our median employee by using the greater of total annual W-2 wages of employees both in the U.S. and the U.K. who were employed as of December 31, 2017 (excluding Mr. Miller), or calculated annualized pay for those who commenced work during 2017 or were on a leave of absence.The employee population consisted of our full-time, part-time and temporary employees.The inclusion of part-time and temporary employees reduces the median of the annual total compensation for the overall group of our employees.We selected an employee from that group and determined that person8217s total compensation was $39,978. The ratio of CEO pay to median worker pay is 541:1.  The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee8217s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices.160 As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.  A 2017 CEO pay ratio survey completed by Equilar of 356 public companies across the country indicated that our ratio fell between the 75th and 90Th percentile for companies with revenue between $5 and $15 billion. Our ratio is close to the 75th percentile for companies with greater than 43,000 employees. 2017 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION The following table provides information concerning the compensation of our Non-Employee Directors for 2017. 160 Name  Fees Earned or Paid in Cash ($)   Grant Date Fair Value Stock160Awards (1.)

      "Pay Ratio DisclosurePursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of the principal executive officer (\"PEO\"). The PEO of our Company is Mr. Olson.For fiscal year 2017, Mr. Olson had total compensation of approximately $4.4 million as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table. We estimate that the median annual compensation for all Company employees based on W-2 gross pay, excluding Mr. Olson, was $91,150 for 2017. As a result, Mr. Olson's 2017 compensation was approximately 48 times that of the median annual compensation for all employees. As of December 31, 2017, we had 120 employees. 46COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORTThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees of Urban Edge Properties, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the 8220Company8221), has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the proxy statement and incorporated by reference in the Company8217s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. 160160160160Amy B. Lane (Chair)Michael A. GouldSteven J. Guttman47PROPOSAL 3ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATIONSection 14A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act generally requires each public company to include in its proxy statement a separate resolution subject to a non-binding stockholder vote to approve the compensation of the company8217s named executive officers, as disclosed in its proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, not less frequently than once every three years. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 14A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, we are providing our shareholders an opportunity to indicate whether they support our compensation program for our named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement by voting for or against the resolution that appears below. This vote, commonly referred to as 8220say on pay,8221 is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but instead relates to the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the tabular disclosures regarding named executive officer compensation, and the narrative disclosure accompanying the tabular presentation. We believe that it is appropriate to seek the views of our shareholders on the design and effectiveness of our executive compensation program. Although the vote on this resolution is advisory in nature and, therefore, will not bind us to take any particular action, our Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by shareholders in their vote and will carefully consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. At our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders voted on, among other matters, a proposal regarding the frequency of holding a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. A majority of the votes cast on the frequency proposal were cast in favor of holding a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of the Company8217s named executive officers every year, which was consistent with the recommendation of the Board. The Board considered the voting results with respect to the frequency proposal as well as other factors, and currently intends for the Company to hold a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of the Company8217s named executive officers every year until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of holding the non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers.Our executive compensation program is designed to encourage high performance, promote accountability and motivate our executives to achieve our business objectives while aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. To achieve these goals, significant portions of targeted compensation may only be earned upon achievement of specific performance goals and are delivered in the form of equity. Base salary is the only type of compensation awarded to our named executive officers that is fixed and not subject to any time or performance-based vestingWe believe that a majority of the compensation paid to our named executive officers should be closely aligned with our performance on both a short-term and long-term basis.

      "PAY RATIO  Beginning in 2018, we must disclose annually in our proxy statement the median of the annual total compensation of all employees (excluding the CEO), the annual total compensation of our CEO, and the ratio of the CEO compensation to the employee median compensation. We employ people in many countries in many different roles. We included all employees in our calculations.  The annual total compensation of the median employee was determined in the same manner as the total compensation for our CEO in the 147Summary Compensation Table148 above. We determined the required pay ratio as follows:  183160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160 Calculating the total annual cash compensation (base salary, cash bonus, long term cash incentive paid in 2017) of all employees except the CEO, and then sorting those employees from highest to lowest  183160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160 Determining the median employee from that list and  183160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160160 Calculating the total annual compensation of our CEO and of the median employee using the same methodology required for the Summary Compensation Table.  The total annual compensation for our CEO for 2017 was $2,265,405. The total annual compensation for the median employee was $98,907, which includes any base salary, bonus, long-term cash incentive awarded, overtime, contributions to pension plans, company contributions to defined contribution plans, company paid car and imputed income from employee benefit insurance premiums made by the Company. The resulting ratio of CEO pay to the pay of the Company146s median employee for 2017 is 23 to one.  42  Compensation of Directors  We use a combination of cash and equity-based incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on our Board. In determining director compensation for 2017, our Compensation Committee sought to provide our directors with a total economic value that adequately compensates them for the time and efforts expended in serving on the Board and committees of the Board, and that aligns director compensation with the interests of the Company146s stockholders. The Board approved the following compensation for non-employee directors for 2017:  Director annual retainer:  $60,000  Audit Committee chairman fee:  $12,500  Audit Committee membership fee:  $4,000  Compensation Committee chairman fee:  $10,000  Compensation Committee membership fee:  $3,000  Corporation Governance and Nominating Committee chairman fee:  $7,500  Corporation Governance and Nominating Committee membership fee:  $3,000  Non-cash equity component:  $100,000   We do not pay separate director fees for meeting attendance. For 2017, the chairman fees, committee membership fees and annual retainers were paid on a quarterly basis in cash.  The non-cash equity component was granted on January5, 2017 to each of the non-employee directors in the form of 6,826 shares of deferred common stock. The awards vested and became non-forfeitable on January5, 2018, on the first anniversary date of the grant. Vesting is accelerated upon death, disability or change in control. Payment of each director146s equity award(s)are deferred until the earlier of the director146s cessation of service or a change in control.  Director Stock Ownership Policy  Approximately 60%of the directors146 fees are payable in deferred common stock. All of the directors, except for Mr.Gilliland who joined the Board in December2017, have over 40,000 shares of vested deferred common stock. The Board has adopted a stock ownership policy. The policy provides that a Director146s annual retainer shall be paid in part in deferred stock equal in value to at least 50% of such Director146s aggregate annual retainer (excluding amounts payable for Committee Chair or membership) until the Director holds stock valued at no more than three times the Board146s aggregate annual retainer (excluding amounts payable for Committee Chair or membership).  Director Stock Trading Policy  The Company146s Officer and Director stock trading policy prohibits officers from the following trading activities in VASCO securities: short selling buying or selling put options, call options, or other derivative securities relating to the Company en\n",

      "PAY RATIO In accordance with Item402(u) of RegulationS-K, promulgated under the Dodd Frank Act, we determined the ratio of: (a)the total annual compensation of our CEO to (b)the total annual compensation of the median employee out of all of our employees, except for our CEO, both calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item402(c)(2)(x) of RegulationS-K. We selected March31, 2018 as the date on which to determine our median employee. In identifying the worldwide median employee, as permitted by SEC rules, we elected to use base salary as of March31, 2018. We did not include independent contractors in the calculation. For purposes of this disclosure, we converted employee compensation from local currency to U.S. dollars using an average of monthly exchange rates for fiscal 2018. The following table provides information, based on our reasonable estimates, about the relationship between the total annual compensation of our CEO and the median of the total annual compensation of all our employees (except for the CEO) as of March31, 2018. Median Employee Total Annual Compensation  CEO Total Annual Compensation  Pay Ratio (CEO:Median Employee)  $14,507  $8,772,998   605: 1  56 Table of Contents We calculated the total annual compensation for the median employee in the same manner used to calculate total compensation for each of our named executive officers as set forth in the \"Summary Compensation Table\" on page42 of this proxy statement. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS Other than compensation agreements, which are described above and the transactions described below, since April1, 2017, there has not been and there is not currently proposed, any transaction or series of similar transactions to which we were or will be a party in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000 and in which any director, executive officer, holder of five percent or more of any class of our capital stock or any member of their immediate family had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. We entered into an Investment Agreement, dated as of May3, 2017, with Orogen, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 108,000 shares of convertible preferred stock for aggregate consideration of $108.0million. Following such transaction, the common stock issuable upon conversion of such convertible preferred stock represented beneficial ownership of approximately 9.18% as of June30, 2017. In addition, we appointed Mr.Vikram S. Pandit, a nominee of Orogen, to our board of directors as a SeriesA Director, pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement and the terms of our convertible preferred stock. Our Independent Board has adopted a written related party transaction approval policy, which sets forth our policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification of any transaction required to be reported in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our policy with regard to related party transactions is that all related party transactions are to be reviewed by our general counsel, who will determine whether the contemplated transaction or arrangement requires the approval of the Independent Board, the audit committee, both or neither. 57 Table of Contents PROPOSAL 2 RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS The audit committee of the board of directors has retained the firm of KPMGLLP, independent registered public accountants, to serve as independent registered public accountants for our 2019 fiscal year. KPMGLLP has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 2004. The audit committee reviewed and discussed its selection of, and the performance of, KPMGLLP for our 2019 fiscal year. As a matter of good corporate governance, the audit committee has determined to submit its selection to stockholders for ratification. If the selection of independent registered public accountants is ratified, the audit committee, at its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders.

      "PAY RATIO DISCLOSUREUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are required to disclose the median of the annual total compensation of our employees, the annual total compensation of our principal executive officer, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Christopher T. Metz, and the ratio of these two amounts.We have estimated the median of the fiscal year 2018 annual total compensation of our employees, excluding Mr.160Metz, selected the \"median employee\" pursuant to the analysis described below, and determined that the annual total compensation of the median employee for the period was $54,060. The annualized total compensation of our CEO, who was hired in 2017, was $7,432,601. The ratio of the annualized total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our employees was 13732to 1. We believe this pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the rules of the Securities Exchange Commission. We note that a substantial portion of our CEO8217s total compensation for fiscal year 201832consisted of awards he received in accordance with his offer letter in connection with his joining the Company, which had a grant date fair value of approximately $2,399,980. Excluding these160equity awards, the ratio would have been 9432to 1.The following paragraphs provide important context related to our employee population and describe the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used to determine the median employee and calculate this ratio.We selected March 31, 2018, the end of our fiscal year end, as the date upon which we would identify the 8220median employee,8221 because it enabled us to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner.Earnings of our employees outside the United States were converted to U.S. dollars using the currency exchange rates as of March 31, 2018. We did not make any cost of living adjustments.To identify the 8220median employee,8221 we utilized the annualized fiscal year 2018 base salary for our consistently applied compensation measure because we believe that this measure reasonably reflects the annual compensation of our employees. We have estimated the median of the fiscal year 2018 annual base salary of our employees, excluding Mr.160Metz, to be $52,264. Using this measure, we identified a 8220median employee8221 who is a full-time, salaried employee located in Olathe, Kansas. Once we identified this median employee, we totaled all of the elements of the employee8217s compensation for fiscal year 2018 in accordance with the requirements of the applicable the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. This resulted in an annual total compensation of $54,060.With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we adjusted the amount reported in the 8220Total8221 column for fiscal year 2018 of our Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement, by annualizing his base salary and certain components of 8220All Other Compensation8221 to account for the fact that he only commenced employment with us on October 9, 2017, resulting in an adjusted total amount of $7,432,601.Because the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules for identifying the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee8217s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio for our Company, as other companies have headquarters offices in different countries, have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios.54Table of ContentsAUDIT COMMITTEE REPORTThe Audit Committee is composed solely of independent directors, as determined by the Board of Directors under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that Robert M. Tarola, Chairman of the Audit Committee, and Gary L. McArthur are \"audit committee financial experts,\" as defined under applicable federal securities law and regulations.

      "Pay Ratio Disclosure RuleThe SEC requires disclosure of the annual total compensation of Mr. David L. Brown, the Company8217s CEO, and the median employee, as well as the ratio of their respective annual total compensation, with the total annual compensation calculated in accordance with SEC rules applicable to the Summary Compensation Table. The values for 2017 are as follows:CEO Salary Median Employee160SalaryRatio of Compensation$5,647,928$43,372130:1Pay Ratio MethodologyThe SEC rules allows a company to select the methodology for identifying the median employee in a manner that is most appropriate based on the company8217s size, organizational structure and compensation plans, policies and procedures.To determine the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, except for our CEO, we used the following methodology:8226To identify our employee population, we used internal records to determine all full-time, part-time, temporary andseasonal employees, excluding our CEO, who were employed as of December 31, 2017.8226To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employee population, we calculated theaggregate of each employee's (i) 2017 base salary paid in 2017 (ii) bonus paid in 2018 related to 2017 performanceand (iii) the grant date fair value of equity awards granted during 2017, using the same methodology that we usefor estimating the value of the equity awards granted to our named executive officers and reported in the SummaryCompensation Table.Regulation S-K and applicable guidance provide significant flexibility in how companies identify the median employee. Each company may use a different methodology and make different assumptions particular to that company. As a result, and as explained by the SEC when it adopted these rules, in considering the pay ratio disclosure, stockholders should keep in mind that that the rule was not designed to facilitate comparisons of pay ratios among different companies, even companies within the same industry, but rather to allow stockholders to better understand and assess each particular company's compensation practices and pay ratio disclosures.48REPORT OF COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORSThe following report of the Compensation Committee shall not constitute 8220soliciting material,8221 shall not be deemed 8220filed8221 with the SEC and is not to be incorporated by reference into any of the Company8217s other filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent we specifically incorporate this report by reference therein.The Compensation Committee of the Company has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated into the Company8217s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.160COMPENSATION COMMITTEE160Hugh M.

The other fees remained the same as in 2016, as follows: Lead Director: $215,000 New Member of the Board (initial grant/one time only): $262,500.

      "Pay Ratio Analysis The table below sets forth comparative information regarding: (1)the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr.Albert Chao, for the year ended December31, 2017, determined on the basis described below (2)the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, for the year ended December31, 2017, determined on the basis described below and (3)a ratio comparison of those two amounts. These amounts were determined in accordance with rules prescribed by the SEC. For purposes of determining the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, for the year ended December31, 2017, the applicable SEC rules require us to identify the median employee, by using either annual total compensation for all such employees or another consistently applied compensation measure. For these purposes, we used total taxable earnings, plus certain non-taxable items, including retirement plan contributions and car allowances/perquisites, as determined from the Company146s payroll records for the period from January1, 2017 through December31, 2017 (the 147Measurement Date148), as our consistently applied compensation measure. We included all employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the Measurement Date, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis and whether employed in the U.S. or a non-U.S. jurisdiction. We did not use statistical sampling or include any cost of living adjustments for purposes of this determination. After identifying the median employee, based on the process described above, we calculated annual total compensation for that employee using the same methodology we used for determining total compensation for 2017 for our named executive officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table.  Chief Executive Officer annual total compensation (A)   $8,513,597  Median annual total compensation of all employees (excluding Chief Executive Officer) (B)   $82,397  Ratio of (A)to (B)   103.3  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Under our Code of Conduct, each of our employees (including our NEOs and other Executives) is required to disclose to us and seek approval before undertaking any activity that could create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest between his or her personal interests and our interests.

      "Pay Ratio DisclosureAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information for the year ended December 31, 2017:183 The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than our CEO), was $44,158 and the annual total compensation of Mr. Clemons, our President and Chief Executive Officer, was $1,056,033.183 Based on this information, for 2017, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is 24 to 1.We completed the following steps to identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees and to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and CEO:183 As of December 31 2017, our employee population consisted of approximately 469 employees, including any full-time, part-time, temporary, or seasonal employees employed on that date.183 To find the median of the annual total compensation of our employees (other than our CEO), we used original gross earnings, which includes all wages paid - inclusive of salary, overtime, straight time, incentives, bonus and commissions - in each case paid before any deductions are made for pre-tax reductions or after-tax deductions for fiscal 2017. In making this determination, we annualized compensation for full-time and part-time permanent employees who were employed on December 31, 2017, but did not work for us the entire year. No full-time equivalent adjustments were made for part-time employees.183 We identified our median employee using this compensation measure and methodology, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation.183 After identifying the median employee, we added together all of the elements of such employee8217s compensation for 2017 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $44,158. With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the 8220Total8221 column of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table appearing on page 23 of this Proxy Statement, which is also in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x).28DIRECTOR COMPENSATIONThe Company8217s directors are classified in three (3) classes, with directors in each class serving for three (3) year terms and until his successor has been duly elected and qualified. The Board of Directors of the Company also serves as the Board of Directors of the Bank. In 2017, each director received $2,300 per month for his services as a director of the Company. In addition, each director received $850 per month for his services as a director of the Bank and $450 for each committee meeting of the Bank he attended, not to exceed $1,700 per month, as a member of the various committees on which he serves. In addition, fees of $2,346 and $1,734 were paid to each of the directors of the Company and the Bank, respectively, for attendance at the Company and the Bank planning retreats held during 2017. Messrs. C. Bell and Comer received $400 per month for serving on the Advisory Board of the Smith County branches of the Bank. Mr. J.

Mr. Jordan received $200 per month for serving on the Advisory Board of the Rutherford County branches of the Bank. Mr. Goodall received $100 per month for serving on the Advisory Board of the Sumner County branches of the Bank. 32160160160160 On April 14, 2014, the Bank entered into a Director Survivor Income Agreement with each of Messrs. Jack Bell, James Comer and James Patton, and on April 6, 2015, the Bank entered into a Director Survivor Income Agreement with Mr. Jordan (the 8220Outside Director Survivor Income Agreement8221). The Outside Director Survivor Income Agreements were entered into to encourage Messrs. J. Bell, Comer, Jordan and J.

      "Pay RatioPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), U.S. publicly-traded companies are required to disclose the ratio of their CEO8217s annual total compensation to the compensation of their median employee. This disclosure requires that our median employee be selected from all employees, including full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio permit companies to use various methodologies and assumptions, apply certain exclusions, and make reasonable estimates that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable with the pay ratio that we have reported. In particular, it is important to note that we employ over 5,000 employees, full and part-time, in our 250-plus restaurants across 20 states in the U.S. and, therefore, our median employee is a part-time kitchen worker who makes $14,800 per year.160 We calculated our CEO to median employee pay ratio in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 402(u) of the SEC8217s Regulation S-K, to arrive at a reasonable estimate calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and guidance. We identified our median employee by using total 2017 compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on November 20, 2017 (annualized in the case of full- and part-time employees who joined us during 2017). This total compensation amount of our median employee is based on part-time employment for such employee, and is not necessarily representative of the compensation of our other restaurant employees or of our overall compensation practices. Based on this median employee8217s annual total compensation and the annual total compensation for our CEO in 2017 as reported in the \"Summary Compensation Table\" above of $2.7160million, the ratio of our CEO8217s annual total compensation to our median employee8217s annual total compensation is 185 to 1. As indicated in the table included in 82202017 Long-Term Incentive Awards Granted and 2017 CEO Realized Compensation8221 above, in 2017 our CEO received two stock options grants with unrealized grant date values of $637,500 and $627,700, respectively.160 These two stock options grants had exercise prices equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant of $23.26 per share and $13.60 per share, respectively.160 For purposes of the CEO pay ratio calculation only, we believe it is appropriate to exclude the value of these stock options grants from the CEO8217s compensation for 2017, because these stock options had a nominal realizable value as of November 20, 2017 (based on the closing price of our common stock on such date of $13.38 per share). 160In other words, our CEO only realizes compensation from these respective stock option grants upon the price of our common stock exceeding the $13.60 and $23.26 exercise prices for these respective stock option grants.160 The exercise prices of all of our CEO8217s other stock options is above the closing price of our common stock on November 20, 2017, which was $13.38 per share and, therefore, such stock options have essentially no value as of such date. Additionally, as indicated in 8220Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal 20178221 above, upon the vesting of certain RSUs, our CEO acquired 3,951 shares of our common stock in 2017, which shares were valued at $91,031 as of the vesting date for such RSUs. Accordingly, based on the exclusion of CEO8217s stock options coupled with the inclusion of these shares of vested common stock in calculating our CEO8217s realized compensation for 2017, the CEO to median employee pay ratio would be 106 to 1. We believe such ratio provides meaningful information relating to the compensation realized in 2017 by our CEO as compared to the compensation of our median employee.33REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE160The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the preceding \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" section of the Proxy Statement. Based on its review and discussions with management, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that this section be included in this Proxy Statement for fiscal 2017 for filing with the SEC.160THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE160Alec Taylor, ChairpersonGreg DollarhydeCordia HarringtonIn accordance with the SEC8217s rules, the foregoing report will not be deemed to be part of or incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates this information by reference, and will not otherwise be deemed 8220soliciting material82\n",
